         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Otwithſtanding the worlds complaint, of the ſurfeit of Bookes (haſty wits being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-forward to vent their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripe and miſhapen conceits;) yet in all ages there hath been and will be neceſſary vſes of holy Treatiſes, applyable to the varietie of occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the time; becauſe men of weaker conceits, cannot ſo eaſily of themſelues diſcerne how one truth is inferred from another, and proued by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, eſpecially when truth is controuerted by men of more ſubtile and ſtronger wits. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as Gods truth hath in all ages beene oppoſed in ſome branches of it; ſo the diuine prouidence that watcheth ouer the Church, raiſed vp ſome to ſence the Truth, and make vp the breach: Men gifted proportionably to the time, and as well furniſht to fight Gods battels, as Sathans cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions haue beene to ſtand for him: neither haue any points of Scripture beene more exactly diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, then thoſe that haue beene moſt ſharpely oppugned, oppoſition whetting both mens wits,
<pb facs="tcp:14192:4"/> and induſtry, and in ſeuerall ages, men haue beene ſeuerally exerciſed. The ancienteſt of the fathers had to deale with them without (the Pagans,) and eſpecially with proud Heretickes, that made their owne conceits the meaſure of holy truth, belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no more then they could comprehend in the articts of the Trinity, and natures of Chriſt; whence they bent their forces that way, and for other matter wrote more ſecurely. Not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the enemies of grace, and flatterers of nature, ſtirred vp Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> to challenge the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Gods predeſtination and grace, out of their hands, which he did with great ſucceſſe as fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with grace, learning, and wit, for ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, and no Scriptures are more faithfully handled by him, then thoſe that were wreſted by his oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites, and ſuch as made for the ſtrengthning of his owne cauſe. In other writings hee tooke more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. His Schollers proſper. <hi>Fulgentius</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers intereſſed themſelues in the ſame quarrell.</p>
            <p>In proceſſe of time, men deſirous of quiet, and tyred with controuerſies, began to lay aſide the ſtudy of Scriptures, and hearken after an eaſier way of ending ſtrife, by the determination of one man, (the Biſhop of Rome) whom virtually they made the whole Church; ſo the people were ſhut vp vnder ignorance and implicite faith, which pleaſed them well, as eaſing them of labour of ſearch, as vpon the ſame irkeſomeneſſe of trouble, in the Eaſterne parts, they yeelded to the confuſion and abomination of Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:14192:4"/>
            <p>And leaſt Schollers ſhould haue nothing to doe, they were ſet to tye, and vntie Schoole-knots, and ſpinne queſtions out of their owne braine, in which brabbles they were ſo taken vp, that they ſleightly looked to other matters; as for queſtions of weight, they were ſchooled to reſolue all into the deciſiue ſentence of the ſea Apoſtolicke; the authoritie of which they bent their wits to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance; yet then Wiſedome found children to iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie her: for Scriptures that made for authority of Princes, and againſt vſurpation of Popes, were well cleared by <hi>Occam, Marſilius, Patauinus,</hi> and others, as thoſe of predeſtination and grace by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riminenſis, Bradwardine,</hi> and their followers, againſt Pelagianiſme then much preuailing.</p>
            <p>At length the Apoſtaſie of Popery ſpread ſo far, that God in pitty to his poore Church, raiſed vp men of inuincible courage, vnwearied paines, and great skill in Tongues and Arts, to free Religion, ſo deepely inthralled; from whence it is that we haue ſo many iudicious Tractates and Commentaries in this latter age. And yet will there be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vſe of further ſearch into the Scriptures, as new hereſies ariſe, or old are reuiued, and further ſtrengthned. The conuiction of which, is then beſt, when their crookedneſſe is brought to the ſtreight rule of Scriptures to be diſcouered. Beſides, new expoſitions of Scriptures will be vſefull, in reſpect of new temptations, corruptions in life, and caſes of conſcience, in which the minde will not receiue any ſatisfying reſolution, but from explication and application of Scriptures.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:14192:5"/>
            <p>Moreouer, it is not vnprofitable that there ſhould be diuers Treatiſes of the ſame portion of Scriptures, becauſe the ſame truth may be better conueyed to the conceits of ſome men by ſome mens handling then others, one man reliſhing one mans gifts more then anothers. And it is not meete that the glory of Gods goodneſſe and wiſedome ſhould be obſcured, which ſhineth in the variety of mens gifts, eſpecially ſeeing the depth of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ſuch, that though men had large hearts, as the ſand of the ſea ſhore, yet could they not empty out all things contained; for though the maine principles be not many, yet deductions, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions are infinite, and vntill Chriſts ſecond comming to iudgement, there will neuer want new occaſion of further ſearch, and wading into theſe deepes.</p>
            <p>In all which reſpects, this Expoſition of this holy man, deſerues acceptance of the Church, as fitted to the times, (as the wiſe Reader will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne.) He went through the whole Epiſtle, but left large notes of no Chapter but this, which in ſome few places are not ſo full as could be wiſhed for clearing ſome few obſcurities; yet thoſe that tooke the care of ſetting them out, thought it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to let them paſſe as they are, then be ouer bould with another mans worke, in making him ſpeake what hee did not, and take them as they be, the greateſt ſhall finde matter to exerciſe themſelues in, the meaner matter of ſweete comfort and holy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, &amp; all confeſſe that he hath brought ſome light to this excellent portion of Scripture.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:14192:5"/>
            <p>He was a man fit for this taske, a man of much communion with God, and acquaintance with his owne heart, obſeruing the daily paſſages of his life, &amp; exerciſed much with ſpirituall conflicts: As Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in this Epiſtle neuer ſeemeth to ſatisfie himſelfe in aduancing the glory of grace, and the vileneſſe of man in himſelfe; So this our <hi>Paul,</hi> had large conceipts of theſe things, a deepe inſight into the myſtery of Gods grace, and mans cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; hee could therefore enter further into <hi>Pauls</hi> meaning, hauing receiued a large meaſure of <hi>Pauls</hi> ſpirit. He was one that ſought no great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the world, being taken vp with comforts and griefes, vnto which the world is a ſtranger; one that had not all his learning out of Bookes; of a ſharpe wit, and cleare iudgement: though his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations were of a higher ſtraine then ordinary, yet he had a good dexteritie, furthered by his loue to doe good, in explaining darke points with light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſimilitudes. His manner of handling queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in this Chapter is preſſe, and Schoole-like, by Arguments on both ſides, Concluſions, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweres, a courſe more ſutable to this purpoſe then looſe diſcourſes.</p>
            <p>In ſetting downe the obiect of Gods Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, hee ſucceedes him in opinion, whom hee ſucceeded in place; in which point Diuines accord not, who in all other points doe ioyntly agree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the troublers of the Churches peace, in our neighbor Countries; for ſome would haue man lye before God in predeſtinating him, as in lapſed and
<pb facs="tcp:14192:6"/> miſerable eſtate; others would haue God in that firſt decree to conſider man abſtracted from ſuch reſpects, and to be conſidered of, as a creature alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and capable either of happineſſe or miſery, and fit to be diſpoſed of by God, who is Lord of his owne, to any ſupernaturall end; yet both agree in this. Firſt, that there was an eternall ſeparation of men in Gods purpoſe. Secondly, that this firſt decree of ſeuering man to his ends, is an act of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraignty ouer his creature, and altogether inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant of any thing in the creature, as a cauſe of it, eſpecially in comparatiue reprobation, as why he reiected <hi>Iudas,</hi> and not <hi>Peter;</hi> ſinne fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeene cannot be the cauſe, becauſe that was common to both, and therefore could be no cauſe of ſeuering. Thirdly, all agree in this, that damnation is an act of diuine iuſtice, which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth demerit; and therefore the execution of Gods decree is founded on ſinne, either of nature, or life, or both. My meaning is not to make the cauſe mine, by vnneceſſary intermedling; The worthineſſe of the men on both ſides is ſuch, that it ſhould moue men to moderation in their cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures either way; Neither is this queſtion of like conſequence with others in this buſineſſe, but there is a wide difference betweene this difference and other differences. And one cauſe of it, is the difficulty of vnderſtanding, how God conceiues things, which differs in the whole kinde from ours, he conceiuing of things, altogether and at once without diſcourſe, we one thing after another, and

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>EFORE the words be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, it is fit to praemiſe ſome few words concerning, 1. the Occaſion, 2. the Scope, and 3. the Method of this Epiſtle. Firſt, the Occaſion was the ſtate of the Church, foreſeene by <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 20. it being the care of a faithfull Teacher to prouide that the things hee hath plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted may ſtand, and take encreaſe after his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.15. 2. The Scope is to teach them the Doctrine of Gods moſt rich grace, and to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:14192:13"/> ſtirre them vp to euery good duty, in way of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe. The parts of the Epiſtle are three. 1. The Preface, in the two firſt verſes. 2. The Matter or ſubſtance of the Epiſtle, which reacheth from the 3. verſe, to the 21. of the ſixt Chapter. 3. The Concluſion, thence to the end. In the Preface 3. things are contained. 1. The Authors name, who is deſcribed by his office, <hi>an Apostle,</hi> which is further amplified; firſt, from the perſon to whom hee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertained, or for whom he was imployed: ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, from the efficient cauſe by which hee was made an Apoſtle, <hi>the will of God:</hi> This anſwereth to our ſubſcriptions, for we write our owne names vnder our letters. 2. The names of the perſons to whom he writeth, who are firſt propounded more briefly, with the place they were at, <hi>Saints</hi> at <hi>Epheſus;</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it is expounded more clearely whom hee meaneth by Saints, not ſuch as are written in the Popes Kalendar, hauing Diuine honor done them, but ſuch as are faithfull in Chriſt. Againe, theſe words may ſeeme to lay downe perſons, firſt, more ſpecially, as the Saints at this place; ſecondly, more indefinitely and generally, as true beleeuers on Chriſt euery where; but the note of quantity wanteth to make this ſence: for <hi>Paul</hi> would haue ſpoken in this manner, To the Saints at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and to all that beleeue on Chriſt, if this had beene his meaning, as 1 <hi>Corin.</hi> 1. This part of the Preface anſwereth to our ſuperſcriptions wherewith wee endorſe our letters; for on the backe of our letters we vſe to expreſſe the name of our friend to whom they are directed. The third thing in this Preface
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:14192:13"/> is his ſalutation. The words of this verſe needing no further explication,<note place="margin">Doctrines of the <hi>1.</hi> verſe.</note> we will note out the chiefe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, which offer themſelues to our obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſo paſſe on to the ſecond Verſe.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> Firſt, that <hi>Paul</hi> doth vſe to ſet forth his calling, before hee entereth his matter with them, it doth teach that Miniſters muſt inculcate to themſelues, and ſuch as they haue to deale with, their callings from God. S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth not text this foorth in the forefront of euery Epiſtle; <hi>Paul, a ſeruant of Chriſt: Paul, an Apoſtle of Chriſt,</hi> but that he found it a fit thing to be propoſed, both for his own ſake, &amp; theirs with whom hee had to doe: Euen as Ciuill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates do giue out their Writs in the Kings name, with mention of the Office they beare vnder him, to the end that due reſpect might be giuen him of the ſubiect: So this great Church-officer doth men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion what place hee held vnder Chriſt the King of his Church, that the things deliuered by him might be accordingly receiued: In a word, this is good for the Miniſter himſelfe, &amp; for the people: <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>1</label> How can he ſpeake the words of God, as the mouth of God, with reuerence and all authority, if he conſider not that God hath commended to him this peece of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice? <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>2</label> 2. The Miniſtry is a worke ſo weighty, that no man of himſelfe is ſufficient for it: Now what can more aſſure me that I ſhall be made able, then to looke at God, who hath called me to ſuch an office? Princes call not their Subiects to any ſeruice, but that they ſee them furniſhed with things requiſite. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>3</label> 3. Laſtly, whereas the difficulties and enmities which encounter faithfull Miniſters are many;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:14192:14"/> how could they looke to be ſhielded againſt all, but by holding their eyes on him who hath called them? For people this is behoofefull, for it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them ſanctifie God in hearing, while they looke not ſo much at man, as at God teaching by man, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.33. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13. 2. It maketh them obey thoſe that are ouer them, when they haue conſcience of this, that God hath ſent them: as a ſeruant, when hee thinketh his Lord or Lady hath ſent any to him, doth readily doe that hee is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</p>

                  </label> The Vſe of which is to ſtirre vp Miniſters wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to teach this, and lay it as a foundation: People likewiſe muſt willingly hear it; for, to acknowledge Gods call in ſuch as miniſter to them, is their great aduantage. When we harpe on this ſtring any thing much, then people thinke it a ſpice of Pride and vaine-glory in vs, comming onely from hence that we thinke our ſelues not enough reſpected; thus <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe might haue been miſconſtrued: What nothing but <hi>Paul</hi> an Apoſtle; cannot <hi>Paul</hi> haue the office of Apoſtle, but all the towne muſt be of Counſell? But as S. <hi>Paul</hi> feared not to prefixe this, howſoeuer his cuſtome might be depraued; ſo muſt we immitate the ſame, in prudent propoſing the Miniſtry we haue receiued from God, though euill minded men miſinterpret the fact, to their owne deſtruction.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">

                  <hi>Paul an Apoſtle.</hi> Obſerue more particularly, firſt the quality and degree of him, who bringeth the Doctrine of this Epiſtle to vs; He is an Apoſtle, one of the higheſt degree, an Embaſſador of State,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:14192:14"/> ſent from Chriſt, for ſo the word ſignifieth. Looke as Kings haue their ſuperiour and inferiour Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, from the Chancellor, to the Conſtable; ſo Chriſt, the glorious King of his Church, hath diuers orders of Miniſters; the order of Apoſtles being ſupreame, and moſt excellent aboue any other, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. And looke as Kings diſpatch Lords Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours into other Countries, concerning important buſineſſe; ſo the Lord Ieſus, now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to aſcend, did ſend forth his twelue Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, to publiſh the Charter of the world, euen for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe of ſinnes, and free acceptance to life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, to all ſuch as would take their pardon forth, by a liuely beleefe. Many were the priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of theſe Apoſtles. 1.<note place="margin">Priuiledges of an Apoſtles, 5.</note> They were immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, no perſon comming betweene, deſigned by Chriſt. 2. They were infallibly aſſiſted, ſo that in their office of teaching, whether by word of mouth, or writing, they could not erre. 3. Their commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was vniuerſall, throughout all Nations, though the vſuall exerciſe thereof,<note place="margin">Gal. 2.</note> was limited and determined by Chriſt, doubtleſſe for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter edification of the Church. 4. They could giue by impoſition of hands, the gifts of the holy Ghoſt, which <hi>Simon Magus</hi> would haue redeemed. 5. They were eye witneſſes of Chriſt, and ſaw him ordinarily, and miraculouſly in the fleſh, as <hi>Paul.</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>
                  </label> That therefore a perſon of ſuch quality, doth bring vs theſe things; muſt ſtirre vs vp to ſeeke into them, and entertaine them accordingly. Should the King ſend his minde by the meaneſt meſſenger, we would receiue it dutifully; but if
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:14192:15"/> my Lord Chancellour, or ſome great ſtateſ-man ſhould in perſon publiſh his pleaſure, we would attend it more reuerently. The Atheiſme of theſe times is much to be lamented: Our ſuperſtitious anceſtors, if the Popes Nuncio or Legate came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, bringing the Popes bleſſing, indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, reliques, ſuch wares as were the mocke of the world; Oh how were they receiued, how were their commodities (if I may ſo call them) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained? But our Atheiſme is ſuch, that we let theſe things lye by; many of vs not asking after, nor vouchſafing to reade with deuotion theſe things which the true Legates of Ieſus Chriſt haue brought vnto vs, and left publiſhed for our ſakes.</p>
               <p>Secondly. We ſee hence the firmeneſſe of all thoſe things deliuered in this Epiſtle; for, it was not ſo much the Apoſtle, as God in him, who indited theſe things: As when a leſſon is ſounded forth vpon an inſtrument, it is not ſo much the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as his who playeth vpon it: So here, I Preach not my ſelfe, but Chriſt the Lord; <hi>an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of Chriſt,</hi> that is, an Apoſtle, whom Chriſt doth take and owne as his Apoſtle; who is imployed about him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. And indeede, this phraſe doth import his being made by Chriſt, rather then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it; and therefore, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. <hi>ve.</hi> 1. he is ſaid an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle of Chriſt, by the commandement of Chriſt; where an Apoſtle of Chriſt is an Apoſtle pertaining to Chriſt, now poſſeſſed of him, and imployed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, hauing beene aduanced to this place by the ordination of God and Chriſt.</p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:14192:15"/>

               <p>Secondly, faith begetteth profeſſion of holines; Hauing the ſame ſpirit of faith, wee cannot but ſpeake, ſaith the Apoſtle; and beleeuing with the heart, &amp; confeſſing with the mouth goe together. Thirdly, holy conuerſation ſpringeth from faith; If you haue learned Chriſt as the trueth is in him, you haue ſo learned him as to put off the olde man, and to put on the new. Faith worketh by loue, euen as a tree hath both his leafe and fruit. And as if a tree ſhould be changed from one kinde to another, the leaues and fruit ſhould likewiſe be changed, as if a Peare tree ſhould be made an Apple tree, it would haue leaues and fruits agreeing to the change made in it; ſo man by faith hauing his hart purified, made a tree of righteouſneſſe, hee hath his leaues and fruit; leaues of profeſſion, fruit of action. So againe man as a new tree, ſet into, and growing out of Chriſt, beareth a new fruit; hee conuerſeth in holineſſe and newneſſe of life. Thus you ſee how thoſe that are faithful, are alſo Saints, becauſe by faith their heart is purified, their profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:14192:20"/> and conuerſation are ſanctified: wherefore ſuch beleeuers, who are mockers of Saints, who will not be accounted Saint-holy, &amp; ſuch who are not changed into new creatures, walking in new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of life, they may well feare that their beleefe is not true, ſuch as doth vnite them with Chriſt; for whoſoeuer is a true beleeuer, is a Saint; whoſoeuer is by faith in Chriſt, is a new creature. We would be loath to take a ſlip, or be deceiued with falſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities in a twelue pound matter: Let vs be here no leſſe diligent, that wee take not an vngrounded fruitleſſe preſumption, for a true faith, which reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on Gods word, made knowne, and is effectuall to the ſanctifying of the beleeuer.</p>

It is a miniſteriall act, which doth apply Gods bleſſing to the well deſeruing children of the Church, and entreth them into the aſſured poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, through faith, of Gods bleſſing toward them: which doth apply I ſay; for it differeth thus from a Prayer; a Prayer ſeeketh to obtaine the things for vs, this doth in Gods name apply and aſſure our faith that the bleſſing of God is vpon vs, and ſhall gratiouſly follow vs: When the Miniſter intreateth forgiueneſſe of ſinne, it is one thing; when againe hee doth aſſure a repentant heart that God hath done away his ſinne, this is another thing: in the one hee ſeeketh to obtaine this benefit for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, in the other hee doth aſſure the party that it is now applied in him.</p>
               <p>The grounds are two. 1. The ſpirit of diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, I meane ordinary, not miraculous, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them by fruits ſee who are ſuch members of the Church, whom God doth promiſe to bleſſe: The ſecond is the authority which God hath put

Now from theſe two, that I diſcerne a childe of the Church, to whom bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing pertaineth, &amp; know my ſelfe to be his mouth to ſignifie it, and inſtrument with whom hee will concurre to produce it, from theſe two, it is that this act of bleſſing ſpringeth, be it a bleſſing in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall giuen, or ſingularly applyed. And hence you may ſee a difference betwixt our bleſſing, and the Patriarchs propheticall bleſſing; for their bleſſings were grounded vpon a Reuelation, in them made, of things which ſhould befall their poſterity.</p>

The Papiſts will grant it meere grace in compariſon that our ſinnes are forgiuen, and that we haue the ſpirit of Grace giuen vs; but after this they ſay we haue to deale with Iuſtice, from which we muſt expect eternall life. A miſerable Doctrine, Grace is in the beginning, Grace is in the middle, Grace is in the ending. A Chriſtian man may be conſidered in three diſtances of time: 1. In the time of his conuerſion: 2. In the time betwixt his beleeuing and receiuing the end of his Faith: 3. in the time when God will giue him the Crowne of glory, life eternall. Now for the firſt, all grant that we enter by faith into Grace; but for our after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, that we ſtand not vnder Iuſtice, but Grace, it is manifeſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.2. in which Grace alſo we ſtand: At the day of iudgment, that we haue to deale with mercy, not with iuſtice, it is manifeſt, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.18. where the Apoſtle prayeth that the Lord would ſhew <hi>Oneſyphorus</hi> (a moſt godly man) mercy, in the day of iudgement, and life it ſelfe, the very thing we come to. Now the guifts of Gods ſpirit wherby
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:14192:22"/> we come to it, is called grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. the end, life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal; not a ſtipend, but <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, a gift of grace; thus it is one way cleared. Againe, in what ſhould grace manifeſt it ſelfe, but in theſe three things. Firſt, in forgiuing ſinne; Secondly, in attaining life; Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in continuing in the preſent grace. Now when we are conuerted, we haue neede of forgiueneſſe of ſinne, otherwiſe what neede we to pray, <hi>Lord forgiue vs our treſpaſſes?</hi> Beſide, euery Saint findeth himſelfe ſold vnder ſinne, and that as an euill with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the will of him, which cannot therefore increaſe his merit, but maketh him more guilty; for heauen we haue no neede of grace, for according to the Law, continue in all perfectly to doe them, and liue; none conſcious of ſinne can hope to liue this way. Now for perſeuering in ſtate of grace, we haue neede of grace, for this we cannot deſerue; but as Gods gracious pleaſure made him to come vnto vs, ſo it maketh him abide with vs, to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh his good worke, which ſhould hee not, all would come to nothing in vs: For as the ſoule en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into the body, giueth it life, ſenſe and motion, which preſently ceaſe in the body, if the ſoule be departed: So here God, the ſoule of our ſoules, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to them, doth produce by his ſpirit, a life of grace, which would preſently be extinct, if he ſhould forſake them.</p>

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:14192:23"/> fountaine, from whence ſpringeth his pittie to vs in miſery; out of which mercy he doth, when now we are miſerable, ſaue vs; thus grace ſoundeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but loue, and the obiect of it is more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall; for grace is toward vs, and euery creature, in innocencie, and miſery; but mercy is onely to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vs, as we are conſidered in miſery; vnleſſe the preſeruing the mutable creature ſubiect to fall, may alſo be an obiect of mercy: but when grace is put indefinitely, then grace includeth mercy in it; for mercy is but grace reſtrained and limited to man, as in miſery; the difference is rather in our man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of containing them, then in the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. Now wiſhing them grace, out of which came true peace; he wiſheth three things. 1. That God himſelfe ſhould be ſtill mercifully and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly inclined to them, <hi>for God is loue,</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.16. 2. He doth aſſure them of all effects of Gods grace and loue towards them, partly in procuring them all things that were good; the grace of the father of lights, being as a ſunne; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.2. partly in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting them from all euill; this fauour being as a ſhield, wherewith the Saints are compaſſed about, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.13. 3. In grace, is included the ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the report of his grace, in ſuch ſort, as that they might haue the ſenſe of it, that is, the diſplaying it on their heads as a banner; the ſhedding of it into their hearts, the lifting of the light of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance vpon them, <hi>Lam.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. Thus when we wiſh one fauour with any, we wiſh him that hee may be in their loue, inwardly affected, holpen with the fruits of their loue, and curteouſly
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:14192:24"/> and kindely intreated, in regard of louing vſages, which is the ſignification of their loue; for if God ſhould loue vs, if he ſhould doe vs good, and ſhield vs from euill, yet ſhould he hide this from our ſenſe and experience, wee could not haue this peace, which is next mentioned. Now then, we may better ſee that this loue of God, is aboue all things to be deſired; there is no lacke in this loue, no good thing ſhall be wanting vnto vs, nay, if euils in our taſte be good for vs, we ſhall not want them; as the loue of a Parent maketh him when neede is, prouide bitter phyſicke for his childe, as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contentments: No euill ſhall haue acceſſe; no, if things good in themſelues be harmefull for vs, they ſhall not haue acceſſe to vs; as the loue of a Parent layeth away a Knife, which is a good thing in it ſelfe, out of the reach of his childe, for whom it were hurtfull: All things which to our ſenſe, and in themſelues are euill, this loue maketh them worke to our good: If the skilfull Art of a Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an may make of a poyſonfull Viper a wholeſome Treacle; no wonder if Gods gracious loue, turne euen the diuell himſelfe to become a helpefull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, ſetting forward our perfection, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9. In a word, it maketh a little eſtate great riches, euery eſtate contentfull: A little thing giuen as a token of the Kings good wil, doe we not prize it more then thrice the vallew of that, which is no pledge of his fauour? And when the loue of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full man is of ſuch force, that many a woman while ſhee may inioy it, feeleth not beggery it ſelfe not grieuous: What a force is there in the grace of

Whence the one and other peace floweth. It may thus be deſcribed; Peace is a tranquility or reſt in the minde, ſpringing out of Chriſts death, wrought in vs by the ſpirit, through the word of God: it is a quiet, I ſay, or heauenly tranquility, for peace, in theſe ſalutations, is oppoſed to feare, griefe, to any kinde of perturbation, which break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſweete conſent and harmony of the minde; <hi>My peace I leaue with you, feare not, be not troubled:</hi> It is a ſweete concord, making ioy in the minde, as the concord of well compounded diſcords beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a moſt delightfull harmonie, in which the eare ioyeth and triumpheth. Secondly, It commeth from Chriſts death; <hi>his chaſtiſement was the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſement of our peace, his ſtripes our healing:</hi> For as an impriſoned debtors peace, ſpringeth from ſome ſureties ſatisfaction, ſo here, &amp;c. Thirdly, I ſay it is wrought through the ſpirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:14192:26"/> any body may put an inſtrument out of tune, but none can reduce it to true conſent, but he that hath the skill of it; And as it is in any mans power to diſtemper himſelfe, and breede troubleſome ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, but a skilfull Phyſitian onely, can reſtore a temperate conſtitution: ſo we of our ſelues were able to diſorder our ſoules, putting all out of frame, but it is God onely by his ſpirit, who can heale all iarres, and bring forth ſweete peace in vs. Laſtly, I ſay by the Goſpell, which is therefore called the Goſpell of peace. Now as man leadeth vs by his outward words, to ſee his good meaning toward vs; ſo God by this outward word, as well as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, doth reueale to vs his rich grace. Now we may conſider this true Peace, as for the ſubſtance of it begun in vs, or as more full, for the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanciall degree of it; for as Chriſt inſinuateth a ioy in part and reſpectiuely, a ioy full; ſo we may conceiue of Peace: For, as there is a light more cloudy, and more bright and cleare; ſo there is a peace, with which more or leſſe diſturbance is intermedled. Now Peace conſidered in the firſt kinde, commeth firſt from this, that Gods amity is reſtored; whereas his wrath was toward vs, now he is attoned and reconciled through Chriſt; the working therefore of our peace, is chiefely aſcribed to this, that Chriſt did aboliſh the enmitie twixt God and man, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. The Angels ſinging on Chriſts natiuitie, <hi>Peace on earth;</hi> in the next words opening the fountaine, <hi>viz. Good will to men.</hi> For looke as there can be no peace to a Traitour, till the King turne fauourable to him; in like
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:14192:26"/> ſort it is with vs, who from the wombe are rebels, if we knew our condition.</p>
               <p>Further, hence it commeth that the whole crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is accorded with vs, euen the beaſts, yea, the ſtones of the field are at league with vs, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.18. <hi>Iob</hi> 7. For as ſeruants follow their maſter, ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers their chiefetaine, ſo doe all the creatures obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently follow him who is the Lord of Hoſts. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, this peace commeth from the doing away of all diſturbance which was within man againſt himſelfe; as the accuſation of his thoughts for guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe of ſinne, the rebellion and fight of luſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his reaſon, or rather the ſpirit of his minde renewed; <hi>we being iuſtified by faith, haue peace toward God, Rom.</hi> 5.1. <hi>The God of Peace ſanctifie you through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out;</hi> by which we may gather, that while God ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifieth vs, hee doth ſhew himſelfe a God that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth Peace; and ſo many as walke by this rule, <hi>viz.</hi> reioycing in Chriſt crucified, who hath crucified the world to vs, and vs to the world, <hi>Peace ſhall be vpon them, Gal.</hi> 6. For looke as the body, ſicke with diſtemper, cannot be healed with the Phyſitians good affection, vnleſſe his action alſo be afforded; ſo it is heere; it is not ſufficient that God ſhould be graciouſly inclined, vnleſſe he ſhould by his will &amp; power cure thoſe diſturbant aberrations which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued vs of all peace. Thirdly, from a ſecuring vs for time to come, in regard of enemies both inward and outward, from breaking the power of them, of hell, death; that they are not able to hurt vs, much leſſe to preuaile againſt vs: For it is not the moleſting power of enemies, but the hurting power
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:14192:27"/> which ſtandeth not with Peace. You ſee how gainfull troubles, and worldly peace, ſtand well to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: ſo the trouble of our militant condition accrewing to vs from theſe outward ſpirituall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, doth not let our Peace, while wee know that all things ſhall worke to our good; that we ſhall be more then conquerers; that God will not leaue vs nor forſake vs. Fourthly and laſtly, our Peace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as aboueſaid, doth flow from the gift of the ſpirit, which teacheth vs in ſome manner, to know theſe things which are next aboue named; we haue not receiued the ſpirit of the world, but the ſpirit of God, which teacheth vs to know the things beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vpon vs;<note place="margin">Nihil no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> precog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitum afficit vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntatem.</note> for nothing can worke vpon the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, as to make vs feare, ioy, further then it is knowne: and wee ſee that a condemned priſoner, though that his pardon be ſealed, yet is no leſſe ſubiect to feare, then before, till the matter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to his eare, and hee be infallibly certified of it.</p>
               <p>Thus much for the grounds, which are in ſome meaſure whereſoeuer true Peace is in any degree.

For looke as vnto bright cleere light more is required, then that the Sunne ſhould be preſent, inlightening the ayre, <hi>to wit,</hi> that it ſhould be in that ſtrength preſent, as to waſte and diſperſe all darkeſome clouds: ſo heere

To open this, you muſt know that Gods grace or loue, doth proue it ſelfe in common to all, or more ſpecially to ſome, and may be called a common or a ſpeciall Grace. Now the Peace which is grounded vpon conceit of a common goodnes of God towards vs, is not ſound Peace, for euen the beaſts enioy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon fauour from their Creator: <hi>God ſaueth man and beaſt; hee openeth his hand and filleth them; his mercy is ouer all his workes;</hi> this more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon or vniuerſall mercy, as I may call it. But here ariſeth a neceſſary queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> How I may diſcerne Gods ſpeciall grace, from this more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon? <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, this ſpeciall grace ſpringeth from another fountaine: common Grace commeth hence; God is a faithfull Creator, patient and kind
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:14192:28"/> toward the vnkindeſt veſſels of wrath: Hence it is that he doth them good, that his goodnes may not want a witneſſe in their owne conſcience, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.17. but this ſpeciall Grace commeth from hence, that hee is reconciled to vs in his Sonne, Grace &amp; truth through Chriſt Ieſus; he hath made vs beloued in his well-beloued, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.7. Secondly, hence commeth a difference in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, for that common fauour giueth benefits to the preſeruation of this naturall life, but this loue in Chriſt, giueth ſupernaturall benefits of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, faith, hope, inward change of heart and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. Hence followeth a third difference: for common Grace is acknowledged ſometimes while the benefits of this life are afforded men, but they neyther feele nor confeſſe Grace, when theſe are bereaued; but this ſpirituall Grace which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from Chriſt, and ſtandeth chiefly in ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall gifts, this is felt often moſt abundantly in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. Afflictions breed patience, patience experience, experience hope, the loue of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhed into the heart; for as the darkneſſe of the night hindereth not the bright-ſhine of the ſtarre, no more doth the darkeneſſe of afflictions obſcure the bright-ſhine of this Grace toward vs. Yea, wee ſhall finde this in experience, if before our trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles we doe not ouertly skinne our ſoares, ſparing our ſelues in our ſinnes, partly by not prouoking our ſelues to due repentance, partly by not ſeeking to get the roots of rebellion throughly mortified, partly by not endeuouring to weane our ſelues from all inordinate earthly delight in the creature:
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:14192:29"/> for our ſuperficiall ſleighting in matter of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, our boyſterous proud impatience not well ſubdued, our vnweanednes to ſome thing or other; theſe 3. doe make an Ecclipſe of the light of Gods countenance, when now we are afflicted: <hi>This by the way.</hi> A fourth difference in theſe graces, may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the effect of them in the hart; for the grace a carnall naturall man feeleth, neuer maketh his heart flie vp from all earthly things, and reioyce in God, whom he ſeeth fauourable, but euen as a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot, her loue is more to rings, bracelets, or gold ſent her, then it is to the ſenders: ſo the world, an adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſe, her affections are altogether on the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and good benefits giuen them, nothing in compariſon, vpon God himſelfe: But the true ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Grace maketh vs loue him, who hath loued vs aboue all things, delight our ſelues in him, ſay, <hi>What haue I in heauen but him, in earth in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of him?</hi> Thus then we ſee that true Peace commeth from ſight and experience of Gods ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall grace to vs, and how wee may diſtinguiſh this ſpeciall fauour. But before we paſſe to the Vſe, a queſtion may be asked, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether a man may not be in fauour with God, and yet without this Peace? To which I anſwer briefly: Firſt, that hee may be in fauour, and want this outward ſenſible Peace in himſelfe: The reaſon is, becauſe this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not my being in fauour, but my knowing and my being perſwaded that I am in fauor: Now it is not impoſſible for a man to loſe his ſenſe and perſwaſion, which yer-while hee hath had of being in fauour with God, his faith may be for a time in a
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:14192:29"/> ſwoon, and ouercaſt with vnbeleefe, Secondly, I ſay, though a man may be without this operation of Peace, yet the grace of the ſpirit, which as a root doth beare this fruit, cannot faile in any who is in Gods fauour: the fruit may be pulled, when the tree it ſelfe ſtandeth ſtill, thus in ioy; Faith we may likewiſe diſtinguiſh, the ſeed of God abiding in vs, though theſe outward ſecondary effects are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies conſpicuous.</p>

Iob</hi> 34.29. Looke as Kings are authors and maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the ciuill peace within their Countries, they keepe their ſubiects from diſturbance by forraigne and domeſticall enemies; ſo God, the King im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall, and Chriſt who hath receiued the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, are fitly brought in as the authors of this ſpirituall Peace: And it is to be noted, that he fitly nameth God the Father, and the Sonne our Lord; for, the principall and ſubordinate power which doe worke any thing, are fitly combined: Now the Father hath all power, and he hath ſubiected all things vnto the Sonne, himſelfe and Spirit ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. But why is not the ſpirit named? It may be ſaid, becauſe the Apoſtle here is directed to expreſſe onely theſe perſons, who haue a kinde of principall authority &amp; agency: Now the Spirit hath the place of executing theſe things, as ſent by the Father and Sonne: But in vnfolding theſe things, as it is good to vſe diligence, ſo it is requiſite to vſe ſobriety. For concluſion; Let theſe be remembred, that though both the Father and Sonne, be fitly

It is neceſſary to conceiue in minde the true God, in Chriſt, though not diſtinctly to conſider the three perſons: The reaſon is, becauſe euery act of religion doth require that wee ſome way apprehend the obiect of it; and as there can be no ſight without ſome matter viſible propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ſo no act of religious worſhip, without this obiect, in ſome wiſe conceiued. 3.

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:14192:33"/> the benefits wherewith we are bleſſed in Chriſt, which is done more indefinitely in the firſt Chapter, applyed from compariſon of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer eſtates in the ſecond. Secondly; the ſcandall which his Croſſe might cauſe, and the impediment which it might put to the fruitfull receiuing of theſe things, is preuented, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. In the more abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute handling of theſe benefits, we muſt marke, that firſt in this third <hi>verſe,</hi> they are ſummarily propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, then more particularly from their ſeueral kinds expounded. Now in this 3. <hi>verſe,</hi> the Apoſtle doth not barely propound them, but breaketh out into thankſgiuing, before he maketh mention of them. Three things being to be obſerued in this <hi>Verſe.</hi> 1. His praiſe, <hi>Bleſſed.</hi> 2. The perſon praiſed, <hi>that God and Father of our Lord.</hi> 3. The arguments, which are two; Firſt, which God is to Chriſt our Lord; for this is vſuall with the Apoſtle, that when he deſcribeth God in petition or thankeſgiuing, that the deſcription containeth matter of ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning faith, and whetting deſire in the one, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues of praiſe in the other; <hi>The God of peace ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie you throughout,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. <hi>Bleſſed be God, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our Lord Ieſus, the God of all mercies and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.3. The ſecond Argument, is from that God hath done by vs in Chriſt, in thoſe words, <hi>Who hath bleſſed vs, with all ſpirituall bleſsings, in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly things in Chriſt.</hi> Now before we come to the more particular conſideration of theſe words; ſome things are to be opened for the clearing of them: Firſt, What is meant by our <hi>bleſsing God? Anſw. Bleſsing,</hi> is ſometime operatiue, working &amp; effecting
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:14192:33"/> the happineſſe of him that is bleſſed; Thus God bleſſeth vs: Sometime it is declaratiue, confeſſing and extolling the bleſſed eſtate of thoſe whom we bleſſe; Thus we bleſſe God, we acknowledge him bleſſed, praiſe, and extoll him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145. <hi>ve.</hi> 1.2.21. where bleſſing and praiſing are made aequiualent. Secondly; it is to be marked, that theſe words; <hi>God, euen the father;</hi> containe a deſcription of God, from two relations vnto Chriſt; one from this, that he is the God by couenant of Chriſt: The other from this, that he is the father; according to that, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20.17. <hi>I goe to my father, and your father, to my God, and your God:</hi> for this, the words beare better then that firſt God indefinitely, then limited to the perſon of the father, ſhould be conceiued in this ſenſe, <hi>bleſſed be God,</hi> to wit, <hi>God the father of our Lord;</hi> for the article ſhould rather be prefixed to <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> doth redound. The laſt thing to be marked, is that the word, <hi>heauenly,</hi> which may ſignifie <hi>things,</hi> or <hi>places,</hi> is fitlieſt taken to note the place where our ſpirituall bleſſings were giuen vs, for ſpirituall bleſſing noteth not the action of God bleſſing, but the effects procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from it; to this ſenſe, who hath bleſſed with ſpirituall things? for the Apoſtle conſtrueth all ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall bleſſings by predeſtination, vocation: Now to ſay, <hi>Who hath bleſſed vs with ſpirituall things,</hi> in heauenly things, is abſurdly ſuperfluous. Againe, this word is in two other places of this <hi>Epiſtle</hi> vſed, to note the circumſtance of place, and therefore is here in that ſenſe to be conſtrued, without more vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent reaſon to the contrary.

Nay, we ſee how <hi>Dauid, a man after Gods heart,</hi> was ſo affected, that he did not onely ſtirre vp himſelfe, his ſoule, ſpirit, all within him, but all the creatures, euery thing that had breath, from the higheſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, to the loweſt creature: This grace being like fire, which once kindled, catcheth hold of all that is neare it. For our better vnderſtanding this due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, I will open two things. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. What muſt concurre in this practiſe 2. How we may keepe our hearts in a good diſpoſition to this duety. To the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing God three things are required. 1. That our ſpirit doe acknowledge his goodneſſe, in any kinde ſhewed vs: Hence it is that the Saints call on their hearts, ſoules, ſpirits, in this buſineſſe: God is a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and hateth euery ſeruice, from which the ſpirit is eſtranged. As no muſicke is gracefull, vnleſſe
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:14192:34"/> the inſtrument be firſt tuned; no more is any voice of praiſe acceptable, vnleſſe the heart be firſt orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. 2. There muſt be a declaring before men of that kindeneſſe and loue the Lord hath ſhewed vs: <hi>Come, I will tell you what God hath done for my ſoule, Pſal.</hi> 66.16. <hi>I will daily tell of thy righteouſneſſe.</hi> We count it ingratitude in men, when they will ſmother benefits, and neuer be knowne to other of whom they haue receiued them. 3. There muſt be an endeauouring of requiting Gods loue, by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering his benefits with thankefull duty, by walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing worthy of them; <hi>What ſhall I repay the Lord, for all his benefits vpon me?</hi> Thus wee count him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull, who doth not bend himſelfe to requite loue with the like, ſo farre as ability reacheth. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Now for meanes diſpoſing vs this way, we muſt labour firſt to know and keepe in remembrance Gods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that which is forgotten, is not knowne for the preſent; nothing vnknowne, affecteth or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the will: A danger vnknowne, maketh vs not afraid; a benefit vnknowne, maketh vs not ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full or thankefull: Hence it was that holy men often made Catalogues of Gods benefits, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated them to their ſoules; See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. <hi>My ſoule praiſe the Lord, forget not all his benefits.</hi>

Now in this we greatly faile, for our corrupt natures heede nothing they enioy; like the eye in this regard, which ſeeth nothing that lyeth on it,

Firſt therefore, the fore-knowledge and predeſtinating Chriſt as man, to the grace of perſonall vnion, and glorious office of a Mediatour, of which we haue, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20. this commeth heere to be conceiued. <hi>I haue ſheepe that are mine, which are not of this ſheepe-fold,</hi> ſaith Chriſt: where we ſee that we are Gods,<note place="margin">Ioh. 10.18.

The Scripture is plentifull to prooue that it is all kinde of bleſſedneſſe, to haue God for our God. Now then if we be members with Chriſt our head, haue we not cauſe to be thankefull to God euen in this reſpect, that he hath been, and is his God? The ancient Church did magnifie God, that hee had

               <p>Obſerue thirdly; In regard of God, what kinde of benefits he doth giue his children; <hi>to wit,</hi> ſuch as are ſpirituall; euery thing in nature doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with that which is begotten of it, ſuch a like nature as it ſelfe retaineth: Thus it is alſo with ciuill men, for they leaue their children, Gold &amp; Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, Houſe &amp; Land, and ſuch like other good ciuill benefits: Thus our heauenly father, he is a ſpirit, he, <hi>ergo,</hi> maketh vs partakers of a diuine nature, who are his children, and bleſſeth vs with ſpirituall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings.</p>
               <p>Now a bleſſing is ſpirituall in two regards. 1. In reſpect of the nature, when it is a thing wrought, not by any power of nature, or meanes naturall; but by the vertue of Gods ſpirit, and meanes ſupernaturall, ſuch as is Gods word. 2. Things are then in ſome ſort ſpirituall, when though for their Eſſence and being, they exceede not nature, yet they are directed by a ſupernaturall prouidence, to worke vnto an end aboue nature, euen to bring vs vnto happineſſe with God, ſuch as is ſpirituall and ſupernaturall. Now God doth thus giue his children many bleſſings ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, for nature; and doth ſo guide all things, health, wealth, ſickneſſe, pouerty, that they worke toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnto the ſpirituall and ſupernaturall ſaluation
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:14192:42"/> of thoſe who are his. If then one ſhould obiect, and ſay, why the godly haue the benefits of this life, naturall and ciuill, as well as thoſe belonging to another, <hi>ergo,</hi> are not bleſſed onely with ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall bleſſings. <hi>I anſwere.</hi> That euen theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits are in ſome ſort ſpirituall, while by Gods prouidence they are eleuated and guided to a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er end then is the ſeruice of this life onely. Hence we may make a rule, whereby we may know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we be Gods true children, whether wee haue the childrens bleſſing. Let vs enter into our ſelues, and looke if we finde theſe ſpirituall bleſſings, then we may ſecure our ſelues, that we are the Lords: Theſe are all of them appurtenances to the matter of inheritances. Now we know, though Parents giue Legacies to many vſes, to many perſons, who are no kinne to them, yet they conueigh the matter of inheritance onely to children; So doth our God giue many bleſſings to men deuoide of grace, to caſt-awaies; but theſe ſpirituall bleſſings of ſound faith, repentance, &amp;c. which ſerue to enter vs into the inheritance of that euerlaſting kingdome, hee beſtoweth theſe on none but children. Let not men deceiue themſelues, becauſe they haue theſe outward things: <hi>Eſau</hi> got the bleſſing, which the deaw of heauen, and the fatneſſe of the earth might yeelde him: <hi>Abraham,</hi> gaue gifts to the children of his Concubines, though not <hi>Iſaaks</hi> bleſſing.

               <p>Some make this <hi>(in Chriſt)</hi> not to be referred to that action of election, but to the end, in this ſenſe; <hi>He hath choſen vs in Chriſt, that we ſhould be holy,</hi> that is, hee hath choſen vs that wee ſhould be holy in Chriſt; but beſides the harſhnes, it is impertinent, though a truth; for, his ſcope is to proue, not that in Chriſt we are made holy, but that we haue this bleſſing of election in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Some take <hi>(in Chriſt,)</hi> as if it belonged to the perſons elected, in this ſenſe, as he hath choſen vs now by faith in Chriſt, to that fore-ſight of his which beholdeth all things as preſent, which are to

               <p>For the time, there are 3.<note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 1.13. 2 Tim. 1.</note> phraſes which ſeeme to note the ſame thing: 1. <hi>From the beginning:</hi> 2. <hi>Before worlds:</hi> 3. <hi>Before the foundation of the world.</hi> Theſe all may note that eternall loue of God toward vs; there vnderſtand nothing but eternity; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe within eternity God doth foreſee the things which are done in time, and therefore though hee choſe from eternity, nothing hindereth (as ſome thinke) but that hee might foreſee ſome thing whereupon to chooſe; therefore this phraſe may be extended, not onely to reſpect the actuall crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but the Decree it ſelfe of the worlds being: to this ſenſe, that hee choſe his in order of nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by his Decree hee laid the foundation of the world.</p>
               <p>The end is all one with ſaluation elſewhere na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; for, loue made perfect is the formall bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe we looke for in heauen: it is nothing elſe but the ſupernaturall being and life of a Chriſtian, which is begun in Grace, perfected in glory.

For as firſt I agree vpon this end, I will help a ſicke man to recouer his health, before I determine to ſend for any Phyſitian: ſo here, God doth firſt by election chooſe to the end, and agree on that in order of nature, before hee predeſtinate meanes, by which he will moſt certainely bring to this end. For the better vnderſtanding of this bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, two things ſhal be briefly opened. 1. What it is.
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:14192:47"/> 2. Why God the Father is here ſaid onely to elect. For the firſt, the common matter which doth concur to the being of this benefit, is loue; a loue which God hath to vs to bring vs to that life, which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue nature; therefore ſometime Gods chooſing, is expreſſed by louing; <hi>I haue loued Iacob, and hated E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau,</hi> that is not, yeelded <hi>Eſau</hi> that meaſure of loue, which the Hebrewes called hating. But there is a further thing in Election, which doth difference it from loue, and that is a reſpect which is in this loue, whereby it is caried to ſome,<note place="margin">Actio collatiua vt intrinſerae formalitatis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectionem cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notans.</note> before other ſome; it ſo loueth ſome, that it reiecteth other ſome from hauing part in it. <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.7. <hi>I haue loued thee, and choſen thee.</hi> Should God haue loued euery reaſonable creature to life, there had beene loue to all, but election of none; he who taketh all, maketh no choiſe of any; therefore God maketh it a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent thing; <hi>I haue loued thee, and choſen thee:</hi> Some make this all one with that fore-knowledge menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29. and it cannot be denied,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.29. Expounded.</note> but knowledge is often put for loue and approbation, and that God knoweth his Church and choſen, far otherwiſe then other things; euen as a man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all his goods and ſubſtance, but his wife and children after a ſpeciall manner: Neuertheleſſe, it may well note, that knowledge which is in order to this action of Gods chooſing, whether going before it, or comming after it. If we haue choſen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to any thing, we know whom we haue choſen, and if we are about to chooſe any, we know whom we are about to chooſe: So God doth not onely know whom he hath choſen, which knowledge
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:14192:48"/> (to our manner of conceiuing) doth follow the act of his will, now being put forth, but he doth know whom he is in chooſing, or about to chooſe, and this doth goe before to our vnderſtanding: And this I thinke the meaning of fore-knowledge in that place: Such whom he did fore-know to be the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whom he would chooſe, ſuch hee did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate; and thus that place, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 1. may be more fitly reſolued; where he ſaith, <hi>the faithfull of the diſperſion were choſen, according to fore-knowlege.</hi>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Now God the Father is ſaid to chooſe, not that the Sonne, and Spirit chooſe not alſo, (for if three of vs had but one will common to vs all, one could not will any thing, which the will of the other two ſhould not alſo will,) becauſe the Sonne ſuſtaineth the perſon of one elected, the Spirit is the witneſſe, ſealing this grace to our hearts: As the Father is often alone named in inuocation, not that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſons are not to be praied vnto, but becauſe the Sonne is conſidered as the mediator, and the Spirit as the Schoole-maſter, teaching vs what to pray as we ought, therefore the Father onely is expreſſed.</p>

Finally, though a true ſanctified man may be deceiued in iudging of his meaſure of loue or ſtrength, it followeth not, that therefore hee cannot iudge at all truely of his eſtate. I may be deceiued in iudging how wiſe I am, how ſtrong, but not in iudging that I liue, haue ſenſe, moue; ſo it was with <hi>Peter.</hi> But this is by the way.</p>

                  </label> The firſt part is not true, as which preſuppoſeth
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:14192:51"/> that things are in Gods intention in the ſame or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in which we ſee them in execution: Things in their materiall exiſting haue one order, in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending another. I want a houſe to dwell in, I muſt hire or build one, I cannot get any let to me, ſay I; well then; I intend to build me a dwelling houſe, I cannot without workemen; I intend in the third place, to hire Carpenters and Maſons, but becauſe my workemen can doe nothing without matter, hence I decree to prepare ſtone &amp; wood: Now in executing, I firſt ſet ſtone and wood the matter, then I hire workemen, then I rayſe the frame, then I enter and dwell in it. In order of materiall exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, Chriſt is reuealed, promiſed, exhibited after ſinne, but he was intended before ſinne; the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle reckoned the order in which things exiſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22.23. the world, you the Elect, Chriſt, God: but he giueth vs to vnderſtand the order of intention: firſt God intendeth his owne glory, then Chriſt, then the Church, then the World: He who is elected and fore-knowne to be a Lambe taking away ſinne, a mediator redeeming from ſinne and death, he is elected himſelfe after ſinne foreſeene, and by conſequent all in him; But Chriſt is ſo foreknowne and elected, <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhould deny the firſt part of this reaſon; for I ſee not why God ſhould not chooſe &amp; predeſtinate him who ſhould ſaue his choſen from ſinne, before he decreed or ordered that they ſhould fall into ſinne: It is no ill prouidence to prepare my ſalue before I will let my childe out himſelfe.</p>
               <p>But ſome may ſay; If God doe firſt appoint
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:14192:52"/> Chriſt to redeeme from ſinne, then hee muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the being of ſinne, and ſo be the author of ſinne: Beſide that, this were nothing but to breake ones head, that I may after heale it. To this I ſay, that it is good that ſinne ſhould be (as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith,) and that which is good, ſo farre as it is good, God may effectually procure it.<note place="margin">Praecipiendo &amp; mouendo, non quieſcendo conſentiendo.</note> Hee is ſaid to be the author of thoſe things which he commandeth, and worketh, mouing the heart by habits which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe infuſeth, <hi>Ergo,</hi> cannot be ſaid to be the author of ſinne. If a man make a gaſh to prooue the excellency of ſome healing balme, I ſee not why God may not prepare and giue way to the ſinfull fall of his creature, eſpecially ſeeing hee knoweth how to mend better then his firſt making.</p>
               <p>To the ſecond part of the reaſon might be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered: that Chriſt was not primarily, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately choſen and predeſtinated a Lambe, a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator of redemption, but a Head and Prince of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, who ſhould ſaue all, to the glory of Grace. Now being choſen to this end, hee is by force of this, hee is choſen vpon ſinne falling forth, to be a ſacrifice, a Lambe taking away ſinne; for hee who is choſen to the end, is choſen to the Meanes.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing hence inferred, is that fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of Faith, and perſeuerance in it, as a neceſſary condition, before we can be elected.</p>
               <q>Such who are choſen in Chriſt, ſuch are now fore-ſeene beleeuers when they are choſen, for none are in Chriſt but ſuch as beleeue: But wee are choſen in him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>The firſt part of this reaſon is denied, with the

Secondly, when now by faith we come actually to exiſt in and with him, who is the roote of vs. Now the firſt being in Chriſt requireth not faith, but the ſecond: the firſt being heere to be vnderſtood.</p>
               <p>To the ſecond part wee deny, that this or any text ſaith, <hi>we are choſen being now by faith in Chriſt;</hi> for this ſenſe maketh <hi>(in Chriſt)</hi> to belong to the obiect of relation, whereas the ſcope of this place doth neceſſarily make it belong to the act of elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in this manner: as for example, <hi>He hath choſen vs in him,</hi> viz. <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> my ſelfe, with you. Thus we might heere take occaſion to diſcuſſe theſe two great queſtions.</p>
               <list>

                  <item>2. Whether Election is of ſuch who are in Gods foreſight faithfull.</item>
               </list>
               <p>But I will handle the firſt in the next Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; the latter in the laſt concluſion or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of this verſe. From this then, that wee are beloued in Chriſt as our head, wee may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our happineſſe. O how firme is that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction which is begun in ſuch a head, who is God with God, bleſſed for euer! If Kings beare

Thus here how firme &amp; ſure is his loue to vs, whom he hath loued to life in Chriſt our Head, and eldeſt brother, who is his naturall Sonne, from whom it is impoſſible that his loue ſhould euer ſtart? and when it is ſure to the head, can the body be forſaken?</p>

               <p n="2">2. That God is mutable, going from one intention to another; and that his will is not effectuall in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing it willeth; that his will doth on fore-ſight of ſome thing, in the creature determine it ſelfe to that, to which of it ſelfe it is not determined.</p>
               <p>Secondly; I hold that the ſureſt way tracing truely the order of things in Gods intention, is to marke well the exiſting of them in execution. Now we ſee firſt the world was made. Secondly, man, and ſo Gods choſen were brought forth in their naturall being, holy, bleſſed, capable of life, if their wilfull defection hindred not. Thirdly; They were permitted to fall into ſinne and miſery. Fourthly; They are by Chriſt deliuered from this miſery, being called, iuſtified, glorified. Fiftly; Chriſt
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:14192:57"/> glorious, as a mediator &amp; Sauiour of Gods choſen, to the glory of grace or mercy. Sixtly; God his mercy glorious, who choſe and predeſtinated Chriſt, that he ſhould be made euery thing to vs. In intention, then this order is to be kept. 1. Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, or his glory, in the manifeſtation of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. 2. The glorifying his Chriſt with ſupernaturall glory. 3. The bringing vs to ſupernaturall being and glory with himſelfe, through Chriſt. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he may bring vs to ſupernaturall glory, to the praiſe of his grace and mercy, either by keeping vs from miſery, or permitting vs to fall into ſinne and miſery, and reſtoring vs out of it to more bleſſed eſtate then euer, it is plaine, that he purpoſed ſo to worke by his permiſſion, that we ſhould wilfully, through our owne default, runne our ſelues into ſinne and miſery. Now becauſe ſuch whom he will bring to ſupernaturall life and being, muſt firſt haue naturall life and being,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.46.</note> and for that, man muſt firſt be naturall, then ſpirituall; and becauſe that which he purpoſeth to permit to fall into ſinne and miſery, muſt be holy and happy, <hi>Ergo,</hi> he purpoſeth to make man, to make him holy, not knowing any miſery. Laſtly; becauſe he that will haue man thus made, muſt haue ſome fit place, fitly furniſhed, in which ſuch a creature might be placed, <hi>ergo,</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeth to make this world which we behold.

If any ſay that <hi>Paul</hi> excludeth works then preſent, when God electeth, it nothing hindereth but that he might from eternity fore-ſee workes whereon, before all worlds, he came to elect. This
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:14192:60"/> is but an old <hi>Pelagian</hi> euaſion; for <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh againſt all workes which ſtand not with free grace in electing.

               <p>Againe, he cannot chooſe on workes fore-ſeene, becauſe he cannot ſee any to come, which he doth not firſt predeſtinate that they ſhould be; Now then, for him to chooſe on fore-ſeene workes, is to ſay that God firſt predeſtinateth, and cauſeth ſuch whom he wil chooſe to haue ſuch and ſuch works, that after he may chooſe them; which is to turne the Cart before the Horſe. This francke loue of his can neuer be enough extolled. If a man of eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie chooſe to him for wife, ſome woman, who hath neither dowrie nor friends, ne yet hath beauty or breeding extraordinary, the part is maruailous in our eyes: But well may we wonder at this fact of God, who when we were not, ne yet had any thing which might commend vs, did freely ſet his liking on vs and loue vs to life. But of this more in the next Doctrine.</p>
               <p>Now we come to the laſt point, to be obſerued in this <hi>Verſe;</hi> to what God hath choſen vs: <hi>That we ſhould be holy, and ſpotleſſe before him in loue.]</hi> This end is al one with that otherwhere named, <hi>viz. Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:14192:60"/> ſanctification of the ſpirit. And heere three things are to be marked. 1. The ſtate of perfection which agreeth to the life whereto we are choſen, that wee may be holy and without ſpot. 2. The circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of perſon in whoſe preſence we ſhal liue this life, before him. 3. The life it ſelfe, which is as it were the ſubiect of this perfection in Loue. A lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to inſiſt in the explication of this clauſe, becauſe it conteineth more then is commonly marked.</p>
               <p>Holineſſe is put ſometime for all, or any ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying graces of Gods ſpirit which make vs holy, 1 <hi>Theſ</hi> 4.7. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. Sometime it is put more particularly, eyther to note a vertue which incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vs to doe in ſuch manner as beſeemeth both the preſence of God and our ſelues, who are Saints by profeſſion; or a ſtate of purity and perfection, to which we come in vertue, and this life of loue which here is begun in vs; thus when Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed are the poore in heart,</hi> hee doth not ſo much note any ſingular vertue, as a ſtate to which ſome heere come aboue otherſome in vertue: and thus I thinke it is taken heere; both becauſe theſe words doe ſignifie a ſtate of Chriſtian perfection, and becauſe here is Loue expreſſed as the ſubiect: the life in which wee ſhall attaine this perfection. For that ſecond circumſtance, thoſe words <hi>(before him)</hi> doe note ſometime this preſence of God, which wee haue heere in ſtate of Grace by ſight, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. But heere it doth directly ſignifie that preſence which wee ſhall haue of God, when now we are brought to ſtate of perfection, when we ſhall walk by ſight, and ſee him as he is. Laſtly,

Let the <hi>Arminians</hi> tell vs what is Gods end in decreeing to giue this man faith and perſeuerance, if not that he may chooſe him to life.

               <q>Thoſe perſons whom God ſaueth and adopteth, thus and thus qualified in time, thoſe he did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, when they were made ſuch by force of his predeſtination, to adopt and ſaue.</q>
               <p>This concluſion is true. God did decree to ſaue certaine perſons, by working in them effectually faith and perſeuerance. But <hi>Arminius</hi> by decree, vnderſtandeth the decree of election to life, as it is diſtinguiſhed againſt predeſtination, which is the decree of meanes, whereby the choſen of God ſhall infallably be brought to life. Now the firſt part of the reaſon thus limited, is falſe: Such whom God ſaueth, ſuch he doth foreſee them in his Decree of electing them to ſaluation; for this taketh away all predeſtination of meanes, ſeruing to bring the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to life, and preſuppoſeth falſly, that God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chooſe any to life, whom he doth not finde or foreſee as actually fitted then when he doth chooſe them; whereas he may chooſe, though neuer ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for the end, if hauing choſen vs he can make vs fit; for our vnfitneſſe for the preſent, to the end, doth not make vs vnfit for Gods election: as for example, I may chooſe a pen to write, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo faulty for the preſent, and vnfit to write with, while I know I can mend it, and make it fit for this purpoſe.</p>
               <p>I anſwere thirdly. Euen of the decree of

               <p>But we ſee the ſecond part of this reaſon would be euidently falſe; for in what Goſpell is it written, <hi>beleeue, and thou ſhalt be elected?</hi> Laſtly, I anſwere, that we cannot gather the decree of God within himſelfe, by promiſe or threatning; for then wee might truely gather, that God had decreed the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall death of all man-kinde, but on ſinning, in the forbidden tree he did threaten, <hi>ergo,</hi> he did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree. <hi>Arminius</hi> diſtinction of peremptory decree, and not peremptory, would not helpe any thing; indeede this preſuppoſeth, that the ſignifying will of God may not any whit differ from his ſecret will, which he keepeth within himſelfe, which is a moſt palpable falſe-hood.</p>

To illuſtrate the anſwere: <hi>Abraham</hi> did verily beleeue that he was to offer vp
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:14192:66"/> his Sonne without any exception; for he did ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine his faith in thinking that God could raiſe him from the dead, not thinking God would repeale his command; yet <hi>Abraham</hi> beleeued not a lye, becauſe he beleeued according to that which was reuealed vnto him. But then you will ſay, God may bid vs beleeue this, or that, as if it were his will, when hee knoweth it not to be his will within himſelfe? Doubtleſſe, he may to proue vs, as he did <hi>Abraham,</hi> whether wee will addreſſe our ſelues conſcionably to obey him, or careleſly out of wilfulneſſe diſobey his commandements. As the goodneſſe of the creature is not in doing what God within his ſecret will hath appointed; ſo the truth of the creature ſtandeth not alwaies in beleeuing what hee within himſelfe hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</p>
               <p>To the ſecond part I anſwere, that God doth not binde any directly and immediately to beleeue ſaluation, but in a certaine order, in which they cannot but beleeue them truely: for hee bindeth men firſt to beleeue on Chriſt vnto ſaluation; and then being now in Chriſt, to beleeue that he loued them, gaue himſelfe for them, did elect them, will ſaue them, and none can truely beleeue on Chriſt to ſaluation, but infallibly beleeueth all theſe other.</p>

               <p>To the ſecond I anſwer, that God doth conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend ſo farre to our capacitie, as to teach vs his one onely action, by which he loueth vs effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to life, by two, which in vs are diuerſe becauſe one infinite action of God doth eminently note that thoſe two are in vs, though they are diſtinct and diuerſe; as the firſt act of election laid downe Gods chooſing vs, or louing vs to an end; ſo this doth ſignifie the ordaining of vs to the ſame end, by ſuch a courſe of meanes as ſhall effectually work therevnto: Thus it is with vs, when we will doe any thing, we doe appoint by what meanes we will doe that we are agreed on. When one is agreed to bring vp his Sonne at a Trade, then afterward hee determineth to chooſe ſome Trade forth, to ſeeke him a Maſter, to binde him Apprentiſe, and let him ſerue his time, and get his Freedome in it: Thus when God hath ſet his loue vpon vs, to bring vs to life, he doth next determine, by ſuch an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of meanes as counſell ſuggeſteth or preſenteth within him, to bring vs to this end, which is to predeſtinate; for to predeſtinate is to decree the attaining of ſome end, by ſuch like meanes as counſell ſhall prompe vs with. Predeſtination may be defined to be an act of counſell, ſhewing meanes effectually bringing about ſome end: as now it is accepted of the will, it differs therefore from
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:14192:71"/> election. Firſt, election is in the will, this is in the vnderſtanding;<note place="margin">Acts 4.28.</note> 
                  <hi>Thoſe things which thy counſell hath predeſtinated.</hi> Secondly; Election is onely of the end, this is of meanes alſo. Thirdly; that is ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the will onely, this primarily in the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, in the will by participation, in ſo much as the will doth accept; for ſhould Gods wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſhew meanes which would effectually worke any thing; if his will ſhould not accept of them, he could not be ſaid to predeſtinate any thing by them.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="5" type="verse">
               <p>This predeſtination is two-fold, according to his ends: The firſt is an act of counſell, ſhewing or preparing meanes whereby his grace in ſome ſhall be glorious; and of this onely here he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, as is plaine in the Text: He ſpeaketh of it as a benefit in Chriſt, as it reſpecteth perſons elect, <hi>verſe</hi> 4. as it hath his terminus adoption. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is, an act of counſell, accepted of his will, which doth ſhew and decree the being of all ſuch meanes, by which his iuſtice ſhall in ſome perſons be glorious: Thus <hi>Fulgentius</hi> doth make predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, not onely a preparation in his eternall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of things which he did fore-know himſelfe about to worke, whether in mercy or iuſtice; and the Scripture doubteth not to ſay, that God did predeſtinate all thoſe things done to the perſon of our Sauiour, then which the Sunne neuer ſaw vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler. The Fathers doe define Gods predeſtination in euill things by fore-knowledge, onely to ſhew a difference betweene the working of his prouidence in good and euill, <hi>viz.</hi> that he doth not worke theſe
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:14192:72"/> by himſelfe, or by command, or by concurring ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually to them, as he doth to good actions. Now that which is ſpoken reſpectiuely, muſt not be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely taken, neither neede men to feare the vſe of ſuch phraſe, which God himſelfe hath not decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: But inough of this for this place.</p>
               <p>Touching the third point, Adoption; it noteth the ſame matter for ſubſtance, which was the end of Election, euen glorious life with God; but it includeth further, a dignitie or ſonne-ſhip which doth intereſſe vs in ſome ſort to life of glory; and looke as the royalty of a Lordſhip, may be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from the Lordſhip it ſelfe, though they goe together; ſo may this dignity or title of ſonne-ſhip from the inheritance it ſelfe, which doth goe with it. By Adoption then, he meaneth here the dignitie and glory of the ſonnes of God, vnder what maine benefit, whether vnder iuſtification or glorification, it is to be conceiued, I will ſhew af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in vnfolding the Doctrines. The ſumme of theſe two <hi>Verſes,</hi> is in larger terme of ſpeech, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth: <hi>Bleſſed be God, who hath bleſſed vs in Chriſt with all ſpirituall bleſsing;</hi> as for example: Who hath elected vs, and not onely choſen vs to the end, but hath ſo ordered all things, by an eternall diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition for vs, who beleeue, that they ſhall bring vs to that dignity and full glory of the ſonnes of God, which is both begun in vs here beleeuing, and is alſo to be accompliſhed hereafter through Chriſt; and this he doth, not looking out of himſelfe to any thing fore-ſeene in vs, but within himſelfe; my meaning is, out of his meere gracious pleaſure, that
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:14192:72"/> thus his glorious eternall grace might be magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, out of which this grace floweth, that he hath now in his time done vs fauour, and made vs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted in his beloued. Firſt it is to be marked in the order that God doth to our conceiuing; firſt loue vs to life, before the meanes bringing vs to life are decreed; This is the order, in which we are to conceiue that one ſimple action of God which worketh our ſaluation: Here election is the firſt in this enumeration <hi>Paul</hi> maketh, and, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.39. <hi>Paul</hi> ſetteth fore-knowledge before predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and when the Scripture ſaith, <hi>we are elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to life, through faith and holineſſe, as the way of life;</hi> needes muſt the end be firſt in order of nature, before thoſe things which ſerue to the end. As it is with vs, we firſt are at a point concerning the end, before we ſeeke meanes which leade vnto it; as I am firſt at a point to Write before I take in hand Pen, Inke, or Paper. <label type="milestone">

                  </label> Obſerue ſecondly; That God hath not onely choſen ſome, but ordained effectuall meanes, which ſhall moſt infallably bring them to the end, to which they are choſen. Such whom he hath fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne, marke, ſuch he predeſtinated; not all, but ſome are foreknowne: God hath ſet an order of meanes, which ſhall bring them to glory: Or looke as when God appointeth any to liue forty, fifty yeares, his prouidence in nature doth ſo worke, that euery thing from a mans firſt birth to his laſt breath, doth paſſe him on to this period praeordained: So thoſe whom God hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to that laſt finall end of life ſupernaturall, his ſupernaturall prouidence doth ſo worke, that all things doe after a ſort conſpire and worke to that end: Euen as we doe nothing about any thing, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the ends we haue do moue vs to worke. If we look at the things before our callings, or after, we ſhall finde this true, though they worke not in the ſame manner; ſome promoting it directly by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, ſome by accident occaſionally: Before our callings, the good things we haue our ſelues in our ſelues, or which we ſee, or haue giuen vs in others, they perfit vs to ſaluation: When God doth call vs; the good things we haue our ſelues, in our ſelues, make vs admire Gods bounty and patience, when we ſee what wee were when hee ſhewed vs that kindeneſſe; Yea, they are after our callings, diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, and helpes, which make vs ſerue God with
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:14192:73"/> more facility and fruitfulneſſe. Some complexions and conſtitutions are farre more accommodable inſtruments to grace now receiued, then others. The good we ſee in others, we glorifie God in it, in the day of our viſitation, though we ſcorne it for the preſent, the good giuen vs in others, is often ordained as an antecedent to our conuerſions, as when God doth giue vs loue in the eyes of ſome good man, ſtirre him vp to pray for vs; Thus <hi>Austen</hi> thinketh that <hi>Steuens</hi> prayer was ordained of God, as a meane to worke <hi>Sauls</hi> conuerſion. The euils we know before our conuerſions, work to this end likewiſe: The Iailors affrightment God had ordained as a meanes to make him ſeek out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: So the ſickneſſes which were vpon many in the Goſpel, made them ſeek out to Chriſt: So the defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity which befalleth ſome, the infirmities, the feares &amp; griefes of minde which follow them, though they know not why, (as we ſay) nor wherefore, are often diſpoſed as occaſions of their greateſt good, of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing them from many ſins: Nay, the ſins they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in before their calling, God maketh them occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally worke to this end; For, after our conuerſion, they make vs more to loue, as <hi>Mary;</hi> more humble and mercifull, as <hi>Pauls</hi> perſecuting, more diligent in well doing, when we were in the fleſh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. Euen as the art of the Apothecarie maketh Vipers into Treacles; ſo doth our God. Now when God hath viſited vs, we proue then by experience, that our good which he giueth vs in our ſelues and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, whether it be ſpirituall or temporall: yea, the euill we ſuffer, whether of ſinne or of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:14192:74"/> whether the puniſhment come immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from God, or mediately from the hands of men; that all I ſay, are ordained to carry vs home to the end, vnto which he hath choſen vs. In the good things we finde to helpe vs, it is more apparant, then that we neede to ſpeake of it; in good gifts which wicked men haue, they are often predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated for our good; Euen as Carriers haue money often, not for themſelues, but for thoſe to whom they are ſent; So men vnſanctified haue golden gifts, ſometime for the ſake of others, to whom they are ſent. Our ſinnes and euils wee ſuſtaine, God doth euen vſe them as Phyſicke to our ſoules, and he prepareth wicked men often to doe that by his children, which thoſe of the skullerie doe by a veſſell when it is foule, euen to ſcoure them from their ruſt: Euen as he predeſtinated his Sonnes ſufferings; ſo ours alſo, whom he hath predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, that we ſhould be like to his Sonne, as well in ſufferings, as in glory. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> proueth, that to the called, according to Gods purpoſe of life, all things did worke together vnto good; and hee proueth it hence, becauſe God had predeſtinated them. Now if Gods predeſtination did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triue euery thing befalleth vs to this end, his proofe were vnſufficient.</p>

                  </label> Secondly, that we are predeſtinate to adoption; Obſerue that the life which God hath ordained by meanes prepared to bring vs, is a life comming im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from his grace, that life which is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent of Adoption, yea called adoption it ſelfe, that which accompanieth ſonneſhip is an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; that life cannot but come from the free grace of God our Father: Adoption and ſonnelike inheritance are not things purchaſed by contract of Iuſtice, but are freely vouchſafed: <hi>Behold what loue the Father hath ſhewed vs, that we ſhould be called his children,</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.1. Ergo, <hi>life is called a gift of Gods grace, Rom.</hi> 6. <hi>vlt.</hi> And that which God will do about his children in the day of iudgment, is called mercy. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. <hi>The Lord ſhew Oneſiphorus mercy in that day.</hi> This is to be marked againſt the Papiſts, the firſt force of their error in the matter of merit beginning here. For they grant this propoſition true,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>They make grace belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> ad actionem dei predeſtinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis eligentis, non ad terminum electionis.</note> that God doth out of his grace predeſtinate vs to life; but this they will not admit, that God doth predeſtinate vs to life, which ſhall come immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately from this grace. Now to conceiue thus of predeſtination, is to take away all the grace of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination. For to chooſe one out of grace to haue this or that hee ſhall well pay for, is grace not worth God haue mercy? As they ſay this is grace, when he might haue choſen others, &amp; left vs, he did take vs, as who ſhould haue life purchaſed from his Iuſtice. I anſwer, here is an action of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to take one before another; but while this is it to
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:14192:78"/> which I am taken, <hi>viz.</hi> to haue a penny-worth for my penny, there is no grace at all ſhewed me. For when actions are defined according to the obiect about which they are conuerſant, if the obiect of life haue not grace in it, there can be no grace in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting to it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, predeſtination ſhould be an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medled action; partly a preparation of things God would doe out of his grace, as of calling, the firſt iuſtification according to the Papiſts; partly a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of things God would doe out of Iuſtice, as of our glorification.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this maketh all that God doth out of grace, tend to this end, that his iuſtice may be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in giuing life: We read the contrary, that iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice ſhutteth all vnder ſinne, that grace may be glorious in all; this wee reade not, and it were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd to thinke it, when all his iuſtice doth in repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation tend to this end, that the riches of his grace may be more diſplayed.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the life to which wee are predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted is here included in this word Adoption; it is called a gift, an inheritance; it is heere ſaid to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained through Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. <hi>v. vlt.</hi> As ſinne reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to death, ſo doth not the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt to life; But grace by Chriſts righteouſneſſe reigneth vnto life, the immediate cauſe <hi>ergo</hi> of life, is Gods grace; for the immediate cauſe of death is ſinne;<note place="margin">The Papiſts make life from grace remote, <hi>quoad radicem,</hi> not <hi>preximè &amp; immediatè.</hi>
                  </note> and God is ſaid to haue made Chriſt euery thing to vs, that our whole reioycing might be in God, ſhewing vs grace through him: not that we might be able to reioyce in our ſelues, as now rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:14192:79"/> to deſerue from iuſtice throgh him: this then is to be held as a principle of great moment, that the life to which we are choſen and predeſtinated, is a life immediately flowing from the grace of God: For this doth ſhew that the iuſtifying righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which God doth prepare for vs, muſt be ſuch that God may vpon it reckon vs iuſt from his meere grace, to the receiuing of life from his grace. But heere is no place to enter the doctrine of iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and merit, the which wee ſhall haue fit oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to vnfold hereafter.</p>
               <p>Now followeth the manner, <hi>[within himſelfe;]</hi> that is, according to the good pleaſure of his will: The firſt phraſe I rather reade thus, becauſe in that wee are ſaide to be ordained to adoption through Chriſt, it doth intimate that we are ordained to be children to him, and becauſe he would rather haue ſaid, <hi>Who hath predeſtinated vs to be Sonnes through Chriſt, to himſelfe, then to adoption through Chriſt to himſelfe:</hi> but it skilleth not how we take it, ſeeing the latter words doth ſufficiently ground the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to be gathered.</p>

                  </label> Obſerue, that God out of his meere good will doth determine both the end, and all the meanes by which hee will bring vs to the end. If God doe chooſe and predeſtinate vs to life, becauſe that hee doth foreſee that we will ſo vſe his grace as to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuer in beliefe by meanes of it, then muſt hee call vs rather then others, becauſe he doth foreſee that wee will vſe his grace offered well, and concur with it in manner forenamed. For ſo farre as foreſeene conſiderations moue mee to take any to the end of
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:14192:79"/> life, ſo farre they moue to intend and execute the meanes which muſt bring to life. But the Papiſts themſelues in this are ſound, who hold, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God doth freely ordaine vs to the end, and that he doth therefore freely call and iuſtifie vs; hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto they grant grace, euen in the execution of Gods predeſtination, and it may be proued by Scriptures: For in calling, two things may be marked. 1. The ſending his word. 2. The work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with it by his ſpirit: now he doth both theſe out of his free pleaſure; For the word hee doth ſend it to thoſe whom he doth ſee will leſſe profit by it then others; <hi>If the things done in thee, had beene done in</hi> Tyrus <hi>and</hi> Sidon, <hi>they would at leaſt haue hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled themſelues in</hi> Niniuie-<hi>like repentance;</hi> &amp; <hi>Ezech.</hi> 3. <hi>I ſend thee not to a people of a ſtrange tongue, they would heare thee, but theſe will not heare thee.</hi> Now he teacheth inwardly no leſſe freely. <hi>Luke</hi> 10.2. <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I confeſſe thou reuealeſt theſe things to babes, and hideſt them from wiſe ones, euen according to thy good pleaſure.</hi> Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Hee hath called vs with a holy calling, according to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and grace:</hi> Now if God doe call vs to ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on without any thing fore-ſeene in vs, it cannot be but that hee did ordaine vs to ſaluation without fore-ſeeing any thing which might moue him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it; this is taught, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. that the purpoſe of God, is according to election, that is, free, depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on him onely who calleth vs to glory, not on any thing in vs called. The reaſon why God ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth mercy, or hardeneth, that is, denieth mercy, is his meere will; That as the Potter hath nothing
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:14192:80"/> but his pleaſure mouing him to appoint or make of the ſame lumpe veſſels to ſo diuers ends; no more hath God: And here it ſhall not be amiſſe to cleare that Scripture from ſome miſconſtructions which haue beene made, obſcuring the true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it to ſome vnderſtandings.</p>

This likewiſe doth preſuppoſe that thoſe Iewes, whoſe obiection <hi>Paul</hi> preuenteth, <hi>verſe</hi> 6. doe by the word of God conceiue the word of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant legall, in this manner; What then? if we be reiected from ſaluation, who ſeeke it by workes of the Law, then the word of Gods co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant is come to nought: Which Obiection, they ſhould ſeeme to make by occaſion of the former Doctrine of iuſtification; but in all of theſe, and in all inferred on them, <hi>Arminius</hi> is deceiued; For it is not the doctrine of iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo much, as the doctrine of Predeſtination,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:14192:80"/> which in the eight <hi>Chapter</hi> went before, which maketh the Apoſtle enter this diſcourſe: For he hauing taught in the former part of the Epiſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. that thoſe who traced the ſteps of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> faith, were his children; and in the Chapter next before, that ſuch whom God did fore-know and acknowledge for his people, they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated and called to faith in Chriſt, euery one might be ready to gather that the Iewes; for the body of them were not acknowledged of him as his people, becauſe they did ſet themſelues ſtiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt the faith of Chriſt, and therefore they were not the Iſrael of God, the choſen ſeede of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the people whom God did know be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and this is that which he leaueth to be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered in that lamentable preface, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. from the firſt to the ſixt <hi>verſe, viz.</hi> that a great part of the Iewes, carnally deſcended of <hi>Abraham,</hi> are reiected now from being the people and Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael of God, the ſeede with which God had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed his preſence and bleſſing: Compare <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29. with <hi>Rom</hi> 9.6.7. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.8. he ſpeaketh not of a reiection from righteouſneſſe and life, befal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſuch as followed ſaluation by works, for thus were the greateſt part alwaies reiected, when yet they could not be ſaid reiected euer before, in this manner which did befall them, and is here lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: This reiection intimated, he preuenteth an obiection, which ſome might make againſt it, in this manner: That which would make Gods word to Iſrael, and that ſeede of <hi>Abraham</hi> fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, that is not to be granted: But the reiection
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:14192:81"/> of the Iewes from being Gods Iſraell, and the ſeede whom he will bleſſe, maketh his word in vaine, <hi>Ergo,</hi> The reaſon which confirmeth this aſſumption is to be gathered from the Apoſtles anſwer; ſuch as the Iſrael, whom God hath lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and choſen, and promiſed to bleſſe for euer, ſuch cannot be reiected, but the word of God will be made fruſtrate; but ſaid they, we are Gods Iſrael, we are <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeede, which are plainely to be gathered from <hi>verſe</hi> 6. and 7. From theſe circumſtances, well marked, we may ſee that the word here meant, is that word which opened Gods gracious election of this people, to be his people and children, and which promiſed his perpetuall preſence with them, and bleſſing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them: The word here meant, is ſuch a word as taketh effect in that part of the Iewes whom God did know before, and is ſtill made good in them; but the word of the legall coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is abrogated to all the choſen of the Iewes. Secondly; <hi>Ieremie</hi> declared the word of the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall couenant to be made in vaine, yet did not this giue place to ſuch an obiection, that Gods word to his people was made of none effect. Againe, the Apoſtle his anſwere was direct, the word is made by mans ſinne in vaine; and to haue informed them in the true end of the word of the Law, and not to anſwer them, that the word of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels couenant is not fruſtrate, when they obiect, that the word of the couenant of the Law is come to nothing; this were but being asked of Chalke, to anſwere of Cheeſe. Againe, we ſee that <hi>Paul</hi>
                     <pb n="137" facs="tcp:14192:81"/> doth not intimate the reiection of the Iewes, as from righteouſneſſe and life, as they were fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of the law, which is a point he commeth to in the beginning of the next Chapter; but he conſidereth them, as part of Iſrael, and the ſeede of <hi>Abraham</hi> onely: for had this beene the thing in which they grounded themſelues, if thoſe who follow the Law be reiected, Gods word is come to nothing, then ſhould not <hi>Paul</hi> haue an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, all who are from Iſrael, are not Iſrael; all who are <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeede, are not children; but all who follow the Law are not the true Iſrael to which God did tye himſelfe by promiſe. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; It is plaine, he intimateth their reiection, as they were the people of the Iewes, as they were denominated the Iſrael of God, which may be gathered from the firſt <hi>Verſe</hi> of the eleauenth <hi>Chapter. Hath God cast away his people? God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid. I am an Iſraelite, of the ſeede of</hi> Abraham, <hi>of the tribe of</hi> Beniamin. Thirdly, No godly faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ones could thinke the word of God falſifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if ſuch as did ſeeke iuſtification in the Law by the workes of it, were reiected; but the Apoſtles and godlieſt a while were exerciſed with this doubt, they could not ſee how it could ſtand with Gods word, that Iſraell ſhould be forſaken, and the Gentiles called: It is certaine therefore, that he doth intimate the reiection of the Iewes, as thoſe who had beene the Iſrael of God, and ſeede of <hi>Abraham.</hi> The Apoſtle denieth the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon on which they thought their reiection a thing which could not ſtand with the immobility of
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:14192:82"/> Gods word. He anſwereth the aſſumption of the latter ſyllogiſme, by diſtinguiſhing of Iſrael and children; denying that all Iſraelites are that Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael to which Gods word belongeth; or that all <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeede are thoſe children whom God adopted to himſelfe, <hi>verſe</hi> 7. but ſuch onely who were like <hi>Iſaac;</hi> Firſt, begotten by a word of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and partakers of the heauenly calling: The reaſon is to be conceiued in this manner; The reiecting of ſuch, who are not the true Iſrael, nor belong not to the number of Gods adopted children, cannot ſhake Gods word, ſpoken to Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael and <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeede: But many of the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites and <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeede, are ſuch to whom the word belonged not, <hi>Ergo,</hi> The word of God is firme, though they be reiected. This aſſumption is propounded in the end of the fift and ſixt <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi> Secondly; It is proued to the foureteenth <hi>verſe.</hi> Here <hi>Arminius</hi> hauing preſuppoſed this word the word of the legall couenant, and this reiection of ſuch as ſought righteouſneſſe in the Law; he thus taketh vp the argument.</q>
               </p>
               <q>If the word reſpect the children of promiſe, then it is firme, though the children of the fleſh are reiected: But it concerneth children of the promiſe, that is, beleeuers; <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is ſafe, though iuſticiaries, children of the fleſh be reiected.</q>
               <p>
                  <q>But this aſſumption is no word of it in <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> his ſenſe, here expreſſed: For though chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the fleſh in ſome other Scripture, doth note out iuſticiaries, ſeeking ſaluation in the Law, yet here the literall meaning is to be taken; a
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:14192:82"/> childe of the fleſh being ſuch a one who deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the fleſh; for it is moſt plaine, that theſe did make them thinke themſelues within the compaſſe of the word, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were Iſraelites and the ſeede of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> in regard of bodily generation propagated from him; and <hi>Arminius</hi> doth decline that, in obiecting and anſwering which this diſcourſe conſiſteth? Beſide that, though the ſonnes of the fleſh may ſignifie ſuch, who carnally, not ſpiritually conceiue of the Law, yet the ſeede of <hi>Abraham</hi> without any adioyned, is neuer ſo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. The aſſumption which is to be proued, is this; That many of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeede, are ſuch to whom the word belongeth not: The word which belonged not to <hi>Iſmael</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> but to <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> onely, and ſuch as were like to them, that word belonged not to many of thoſe who are the ſeede of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and Iſraelites: But the word ſhewing Gods loue, choiſe, adoption, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Iſrael, and <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeede, belonged not to <hi>Eſau, Iſmael,</hi> and ſuch as they were, but to <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob.</hi> Here <hi>Arminius</hi> hauing thoſe le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall iuſticiaries, thus gathereth his ſillogiſme.</q>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Iſmael</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> were types of ſuch as ſought iuſtice in the Law: <hi>Iſmael</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected; <hi>Iſaac</hi> was reckoned in the ſeede; <hi>Iſaac</hi> was a type of the children of the promiſe; <hi>Ergo,</hi> the children of the promiſe are the ſeede. <hi>Iſmael</hi> was not in the ſeede, but <hi>Iſmael</hi> was a type of all who ſought righteouſneſſe in the Law of all the children of the fleſh; <hi>Ergo,</hi> the children of the fleſh were not in the ſeede.</q>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:14192:83"/>
               <p>
                  <q>The concluſions are true, but not pertinent to this ſenſe; for the children of the fleſh heere are thoſe onely who in courſe of nature came from <hi>Abraham:</hi> the children of the promiſe thoſe who were ſo borne of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that they were in <hi>Iſaac</hi> called to the heauenly benediction. But in laying downe this reiection of <hi>Eſau</hi> from benefit of this word, belonging to the ſeede and taking of <hi>Iacob,</hi> he ſheweth plainely, that it is not a reiecting of thoſe in <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeede, who were iuſticiaries as iuſticiaries, becauſe that <hi>Eſau</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected before hee was borne, or had done good or euill, from part in that word made to Iſrael and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> taken to the heauenly benedicton be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any thing which might moue thereunto: marke, <hi>Ergo,</hi> in the 10.11.12.13. <hi>ver.</hi> three things. Firſt, the equity of <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi> in Parents con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, merits, demerits, onely in birth <hi>Eſau</hi> had preheminence. Secondly, marke the word <hi>Came,</hi> ſignifying the election of the one, &amp; calling him to the heauenly inheritance, with the reiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the other, which is laid downe, <hi>verſe</hi> 12.13. Thirdly, Marke the end, why God did chooſe and refuſe, before merits or demerits in the end of the 11. <hi>verſe,</hi> by a Parentheſis, <hi>viz.</hi> that Gods purpoſe according to his free election might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide for euer, while it depended not on workes in men, which are changeable, but on himſelfe, who freely calleth whom he wil to this heauenly glory. The ſcope of this example is the ſame with the other, <hi>viz.</hi> to proue that all of Iſrael, and all the ſeede of <hi>Abraham</hi> were not ſuch to whom the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:14192:83"/> word declaring Gods free Election and Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the heauenly inheritance belonged.</q>
               </p>
               <p>That word which belonged not to <hi>Eſau,</hi> but to <hi>Iacob,</hi> that belonged not to many of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, &amp; by conſequence that may ſtand firme, though a multitude of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeede be reiected: but the word declaring Gods election, &amp;c. But the Apoſtle doth lay downe the manner after which the word chooſing and adopting Iſraell, refuſing <hi>Eſau,</hi> was giuen forth, <hi>viz.</hi> that it came without reſpect of good or euill, which might moue vnto it, that hee may preuent a ſecond obiection which the Iewes might make from their owne righteouſneſſe, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Gentiles, ſinners; for they might thinke it impoſſible that Gods word could ſtand with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecting them, who were righteous in compariſon of the Gentiles receiued; for hee conceiued this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in that quaerulous obiection: Firſt is Gods induration a cauſe why hee is angry with vs? Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, can he be angry with vs who are hardned by his vnreſiſtable will? Thirdly, can he be angry with vs iuſtly? The Apoſtle in this 21. <hi>ver.</hi> telleth vs, that that induration is not the cauſe of Gods anger, but anger of induration; for none are hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned but veſſels now of wrath, by their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing. 2. Saith he, God beareth them with much patience, and doth not harden them by will irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtable. 3. God doth it for moſt iuſt ends, and thus a reddition might be framed, ſaith he, a <hi>maiori ad minus:</hi> Shall the Potter haue ſuch abſolute power in his clay, and ſhall not God haue power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree the hardning of thoſe who iuſtly deſerue it?
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:14192:84"/> and that with ſuch a will as doth expect with much patience their conuerſion, and all for the obtaining of moſt iuſt things: But for this latter it is plaine the argument of the Potter is a <hi>pari</hi> or <hi>minori,</hi> if it be compared to God: Shall we thinke that God hath leſſe power ouer his creatures then the Potter? God I ſay,<note place="margin">Beſides that Gods actuall induration be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth where his patience endeth.</note> who createth and maketh the clay, hee diſpoſeth? And to vſe this ſimilitude to <hi>Arminius,</hi> his order is to illuſtrate a thing by that which hath nothing like; for Gods worke (by that <hi>Arminius</hi> conceiueth) hath no reſemblance to that the Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter doth, as is already ſhewed. For the matter an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</p>
               <p>Firſt, he conceiueth not the queſtion right: They aske not whether Gods induration be cauſe of his anger, but whether God may be angry at them who come to this ſtate of being hardned? Now this is certaine, that men hardned and forſaken, are the obiect about which Gods anger is exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as a malefactor puniſhed is the obiect about which the Magiſtrates anger is exerciſed, though puniſhment is not the cauſe why he is angry, but the effect of it; neyther is there one word in this verſe, which teſtifieth God to harden ſuch, with whom he is angry for ſinne, vnleſſe to beare with patience, ſignifie to harden, and veſſels made or prepared to deſtruction, men now hauing by ſinne prouoked God: the firſt abſurd, that an act of patience ſhould be induration oppoſed to mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; the other equiuocall, as a veſſell prepared to glory is not a veſſel now beleeuing and ſanctified, and actually fitted for glory; ſo on the contrarie.</p>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:14192:84"/>
               <p>For the ſecond it is falſe that heere is any thing to teſtifie Gods will vnreſiſtable, which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle did neuer except againſt, but rather iuſtifie, and yet maintaine it equall by a compariſon fore-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued. And this is no argument why his decreeing will ſhould not be irreſiſtable; this I ſay, that hee vſeth patience toward thoſe whom he hath decreed to reiect, hee conceiueth the will of God to haue come to election, and otherwiſe to include an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite as it were, of hauing ſome thing which hee will not worke by his omnipotency, but he whoſe omnipotency is not in euery thing, he is not a God omnipotent; for there are ſome things in which he is not omnipotent; not to name the ſame things he would haue of vs, he hath couenanted to worke them in vs, <hi>I will put my ſpirit in your hearts, and make you, &amp;c.</hi> and that there is no power in God which is not infinite and omnipotent; true it is that the verſe ſetteth downe iuſt ends, and that therefore God hath power to purpoſe and worke moſt iuſtly that which is decreed and done to ſo iuſt purpoſe. Theſe are collections which his head hath dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, but not once imagined by the Apoſtle: and marke now how the Apoſtle hath foyled the cauſe of God, by ſtrugling ſo laboriouſly and myſtically againſt that which might ſo eaſily be anſwered: They ſeeme to murmure againſt God; if he be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry at them who are hardned by his will, or a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of his will irreſiſtable: The plaine anſwere is, God is not vniuſt though he be angry, becauſe the decree of his will did determine the hardning of none, but ſuch who ſhould firſt by their vngrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:14192:85"/> and horrible vnbeleefe prouoke his iuſt anger and induration, (whereas you thinke that hee did decree to bring you to this with a will vnreſiſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,) the truth is, he did decree nothing about you, but conditionally, putting alſo the condition ſo in your power, that you might haue kept your ſelfe from comming into the number of thoſe, who are in his anger hardned, if you would, but you would not. The manner, <hi>ergo,</hi> laid downe, preuenteth ſuch a thought, in as much as this might be deduced from it; That word which doth ſignifie ſuch an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection and adoption, as doe not depend, nor once reſpect any merit in the creature, that word is ſinne, though the Iew, righteous in compariſon of the Gentiles, be reiected, and the ſinfull Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles receiued: The end ſhewing why God would not looke at any thing in ſuch whom hee elected and called, <hi>viz.</hi> that his decree and word about ſome whom he had elected, might abide ſurely, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king effect, while the ſtability and efficacy of it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on him freely calling, not on vs; for did Gods decree, or word, touching ſaluation, depend on men, it would proue more vnſtable then a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree in Chancery; as we ſee in <hi>Arminius</hi> his decrees, I will ſaue them all, if they will obey me; I ſee they will not, but they will ſinne: Well, I muſt let them, but I will condemne them all; I but my mercy heere muſt moderate Iuſtice, this decree muſt not be peremptory: I will ſend Chriſt to redeeme all, that I may ſaue all againe: I decree to ſaue all, if they will beleeue, but I ſee they will not; I will ſaue ſuch as I ſee now beleeue with perſeuerance,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:14192:85"/> and reiect others: that order was fit in electing, which doth make Gods decree moſt firme, and of moſt effect to his elected; but to chooſe them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reſpect to their workes, was fit to this end; <hi>Ergo,</hi> hee did chooſe in this order, not looking at any thing in them, but at his gracious pleaſure; and in theſe examples, as in types, are laid downe, all the high points of election, <hi>viz.</hi> that God doth chooſe vs before we are, that God doth not looke at any thing in vs, for which to chooſe vs; for though it is true they were in their cauſes, yea, in ſome degree out of them, yet they are brought in as now choſen, when they were not manifeſtly in the nature of things, but creatures to be borne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards; and though they both had in <hi>Adam</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, yet this is excluded in their typicall conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and they are heere brought in as hauing done nothing. Like as <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> had Father, Mother, length of daies, but as hee is a type, none of theſe things come to be conſidered in him. What ſaith <hi>Arminius</hi> heere? He maketh the 10.11.12.13. <hi>verſes</hi> to contain theſe two things, the Type, &amp; the explication of the Type; the Type, ſet forth with ſundry circumſtances, which are not ſo much to be heeded as the things typified, expreſly ſet downe in theſe words; <hi>That the purpoſe of God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his choyce of ſome, or in which hee chooſeth ſome to life, reiecting others, might be firme, while it dependeth not on works of the Law, but on faith, obeying him that calleth.</hi> From which explication he gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth two ſyllogiſmes, proouing things to his thought, which goe before.</p>
               <q>

               </q>
               <p>To anſwer which things briefly, the perſons na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, are heere to be conſidered perſonally, and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pically. Perſonally, becauſe elſe he doth not proue that Iſraelites the ſeede of <hi>Abraham</hi> may be reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. Typically, becauſe they are heads of all the choſen and reiected, both in the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> &amp; in the Gentiles alſo. But that they are types here of perſons qualified with zeale of the Law, or faith on Chriſt, this is a dreame without proofe, meerely preſumed, which before hath beene ſufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:14192:86"/> and ſhall be further touched, in this which followeth. Firſt then, to the circumſtances, why are we not to ſtand vpon them, ſeeing betweene types and things typified, there is ſuch analogie, as that thereby one doth lead vs to the other? But he doth ſee well that theſe things here ſet down in the types cannot ſtand with that hee would haue typified. How can <hi>Eſau</hi> now conſidered without workes, good or euil, when he is reiected, be a type of thoſe who are reiected as ſinners for righteouſneſſe by workes of the Law? Or how can <hi>Iacob,</hi> as he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered without faith, or any other worke, when now hee is choſen and called, be a type of ſuch who are now choſen, when God doth ſee beliefe with perſeuerance in them? Againe, this decree e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting <hi>Iacob,</hi> did offer him grace aboue <hi>Eſau;</hi> but the decree of ſauing <hi>Iacob,</hi> if hee would beleeue and obey the heauenly calling, doth offer no leſſe to <hi>Eſau,</hi> or any other. Now his conceiuing the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle to explane his type in that parentheſis, is moſt abſurd; doth the note of a final cauſe or euent, that, or to the end, that his purpoſe doth thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the accommodation of a type propounded? it is an example not to be ſeconded; nothing is more plaine then that it is added to note the end or euent of that manner electing and reiecting, which are heere expreſſed: and for the two concluſions hee doth argue from theſe words; The firſt is true, but not a thing heere to be prooued; for the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle had ſaid that, <hi>ergo,</hi> the word was true, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the multitude of Iſraelites were reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; becauſe that all Iſraelites were not that Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:14192:87"/> and all the ſeede of <hi>Abraham</hi> were not thoſe children to whom the word belonged: This is then that which here is to be concluded, that thoſe who are the ſeede of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and Iſraelites in courſe of nature, were not that Iſraell, and that ſeede, to whom the word ſignifying Gods election and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption belonged: the force of the argument ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is in this, not that the decree is after election, but that <hi>Iacob</hi> onely was in decree of election, and <hi>Eſau</hi> borne alike of <hi>Iſaac</hi> was not.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſyllogiſme concludeth a thing that neuer came into the Apoſtles minde, and cannot be accommodated to theſe types, vnleſſe types in that wherein they are types may be contrary to the thing teſtified by them; as I haue ſhewed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue. Beſide, who will yeeld him that Gods cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, is heere put for faith obeying God calling, when the ſight of faith and euery thing elſe was before excluded in this election of <hi>Iacob;</hi> and therefore the decree electing him excludeth and oppoſeth it ſelfe in workes to this faith, aſwell as any other thing. Now then we ſee that this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree electing and adopting, is ſo from Gods will, that nothing in man is conſidered in it, as a meane or cauſe, but onely his meere pleaſure: for cleering which, I entred the explication of this place: to this only the context following will agree, which ſeeing I am thus far entred, I will ſhew ſo ſhortly as I can.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What ſhall wee ſay then</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>is there iniuſtice with God? God forbid. For hee ſaith to Moſes.</hi> This is plaine, that the doctrine next before deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, giueth occaſion to this obiection. Let any
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:14192:87"/> iudge then whether <hi>Arminius</hi> his ſenſe is made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably a ground of this imagination; we ſee this doth naturally ariſe from our conſtruction; for if God from his meere pleaſure doth chooſe one, &amp; cal him to adoption and the heauenly inheritance, reiecting another euery way equal to him; Then God ſeemeth vniuſt, for vpon his meere pleaſure, to deale ſo vne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually with equals, vpon meere pleaſure ſeemeth ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hard; doe but lay that of <hi>Arminius</hi> by it, and there neede no other confutation. If God decree to reiect ſuch as reiect his grace offered in Chriſt, ſtiffely clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to their own righteouſnes; &amp; if out of his meere pleaſure, none deſeruing it, he decree to ſaue ſuch as ſhal by faith lay hold on his mercy offered in Chriſt, then he ſeemeth vniuſt. I anſwer; Here is no ſhew of iniuſtice to the reaſon of man; for that which he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth to be the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of their ſuſpecting iniuſtice; namely, that God ſhold of his meere pleaſure decree that beleeuers on Chriſt, not followers of the Law, ſhould be ſaued, contrary to his former decree in the couenant with <hi>Adam;</hi> for had this beene the ground of their imputation, the Apoſtle ſhould haue anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that God did not of meere pleaſure decree o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe about attaining life, then at firſt he had; but he came to this couenant of the Goſpell, by reaſon that we had broken the former, and through weake fleſh, made it impoſſible to vs: But he maintaineth the will of God from meere pleaſure, ſhowing mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to <hi>Iacob</hi> to haue beene iuſt in him; it followeth.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Hee who hath power to ſhew ſauing mercy where himſelfe pleaſeth, he is not vniuſt in ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſome, without any conſideration on their
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:14192:88"/> parts, and denying to other ſome.</p>
                  <p>But God hath power to ſhew mercy, elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, adopting, calling to the heauenly inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, to whom he will.</p>
               </q>
               <p>This is the expreſſe teſtimony of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which tendeth to proue God free from iniuſtice in his grace to <hi>Iacob,</hi> and in denying it to <hi>Eſau:</hi> For if hee may ſhow it to ſuch as he pleaſe, hee may refuſe it others by the ſame liberty; He doth amplifie this by a conſectory deduced.</p>
               <q>That which is wholly in the free pleaſure of God, that commeth not from any thing in the power of man: But this mercy, electing, adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, calling, is meerely in Gods free pleaſure; it is not therefore in man to procure it, but in Gods liberty to ſhow this mercy.</q>
               <p>This anſwere doth plainely ſhew, that the point which diſtaſted was this; That God ſhould at his meere pleaſure ſhow mercy to <hi>Iacob,</hi> which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed <hi>Eſau;</hi> which would make our election, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, adoption, quite out of our power, meerely depending on Gods free pleaſure: For, both theſe are here auouched to ſtand with iuſtice in God, what euer might be ſurmiſed: And marke here, that the Apoſtle doth maintaine it without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtice, to ſhow and refuſe mercy, when he conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth not any thing in the perſons which might make this equall: For were the equity of Gods mercy ſhewed to <hi>Iacob,</hi> and denied <hi>Eſau</hi> in this, that now all were become children of wrath, whom God might pardon and reſtore, or leaue and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute at his pleaſure; then the Apoſtle ſhould in
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:14192:88"/> the honour hee owed to the name of God, haue here expreſſed this conſideration, that God might iuſtly ſhow mercy to ſome, and deny it to other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, who were no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>If that purpoſe, God reiecting ſuch as ſeeke righteouſneſſe by their owne workes, electing beleeuers, depend onely on his mercy, then it is not vniuſt.</p>

               </q>
               <p>Firſt; Marke how he maketh the Apoſtle not anſwer the difficulty of the Obiection, which was this; How could God goe from one Couenant, decreeing ſaluation on workes, and decree contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that not workers, but beleeuers ſhould be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued? for Gods mercy cannot be the cauſe, nothing elſe comming betweene, why God ſhould change his order, and goe from one vnto a contrary. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly; Let him ſhow how mercy can be the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cauſe, why a iuſticiarie, cleauing to his own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, is reiected from ſaluation. Thirdly; The Apoſtle doth not proue this decree, that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers ſhal be ſaued, to be iuſt in God, but Gods ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercy in deſtination and execution to one
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:14192:89"/> before another. Now this decree, I will ſaue all that ſhall beleeue; doth not ſhow any mercy to one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore another, but offers mercy to all alike. Laſtly; Who would euer accuſe the mercy of God, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeing in a iuſt courſe to bring men to ſaluation, when now they had made themſelues guilty of wrath: Marke how he depraueth that conſectorie, which ſhoweth that it is not in our power now vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der wrath to deſerue that God ſhould decree the ſaluation of vs, in caſe we would beleeue. But why Gods decree of election falleth on my perſon to life, this he maketh in our power, which is the chiefe thing here excluded; for from that God had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and performed to <hi>Iacob,</hi> and from that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge that God will at his pleaſure both intend and manifeſt his ſauing mercy and compaſſions, this is deduced, that this mercy, electing, calling, and adopting one before another, is not in the will or indeauour of man, but in God freely ſhowing compaſſion: Not to ſay, he ſhould tell vs a great matter, in concluding with a ſolemne Epiphone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma; ſuch a point as this, that man vnder ſinne and death, could not deſerue, or any way cauſe why God ſhould ſtrike that couenant of the Goſpel, and promiſe ſaluation vpon beleeuing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For the Scripture ſaith to Pharaoh.]</hi> The 17. <hi>Verſe</hi> followeth: The connexion may be diuerſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, either to proue that God ſheweth mercy at his pleaſure to ſome, ſo as he denieth it to other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome; or that which went before, that it is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing in vs which maketh vs elected like <hi>Iacob,</hi> or reiected as <hi>Eſau;</hi> &amp; then the proofe erre thus; the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:14192:89"/> Scripture doth teſtifie, that hardening and deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercy dependeth on Gods meere pleaſure, no leſſe then ſhewing mercy; Or we may conceiue it as in reference to the vnrighteouſneſſe formerly obiected; for that obiection had a double fact gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing occaſion; God electing <hi>Iacob,</hi> reiecting <hi>Eſau,</hi> without any thing that deſerued it, whence God might ſeeme ſubiect to iniuſtice in two regards; Firſt, for ſhowing his grace to the one before the other, when they both were alike. Secondly; In refuſing the one out of his meere will, and exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him from the grace ſhewed the other, when he had done nothing to deſerue it.</p>
               <p>Hitherto hee hath anſwered the firſt part of the obiection, that God in ſhowing mercy to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals, vnequally is not vniuſt. Now he anſwereth the other part.</p>
               <q>That which God hath done, that is in the freedome of his will iuſtly to doe: But God hath for ends of his glory, without any thing done on their parts to moue him, denied grace to ſome, and hardened them, which is plaine in this example; he did raiſe vp <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> not yet being, purpoſing to harden and puniſh him; <hi>Ergo,</hi> as hee ſhoweth mercy where hee will, ſo he hardeneth, that is, denyeth mercy, and ſo hardens and puniſheth whom he will.</q>
               <p>The Aſſumption is the example, the Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on followeth it. <hi>Arminius</hi> is here ſtill like himſelfe, he frameth a double Sylogiſme, taking away ſhew of vnrighteouſneſſe in his decree, made with electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſome, reiection of other ſome.</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:14192:90"/>
                  <p>That which God iuſtly doth, that he may decree to doe.</p>
                  <p>But hee ſtirreth vp, hardneth ſome iuſtly. <hi>Ergo,</hi> he may decree it without iniuſtice.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The ſecond Syllogiſme, from the 18. <hi>Verſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Hee who ſheweth mercy and hardeneth, may decree according to election, to ſhew mercy to ſome beleeuing, and to reiect ſuch as ſeeke righteouſneſſe in the workes of the Law. But God ſhoweth mercy on whom he will, &amp;c.</q>
               <p>For the firſt, it is true that is gathered, but not pertinent; for this example is brought to ſhew that God may reiect a perſon without iniuſtice, when he hath done nothing for which Gods will ſhould be moued to reiect him; and it is to be well noted, that the minde of God cannot be too prone, that he may make a decree to reiect a perſon that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth righteouſneſſe in the Law; for <hi>Pharaoh</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be conſidered, as in the number of thoſe Iewes who were zealous for the Law. Beſide that, it could neuer ſeeme in appearance vnrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to decree when a man is now a childe of death, that if he will not accept of Gods mercy in Chriſt his Sonne, but cleaue to his owne righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, then he ſhall be reiected. And for the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Syllogiſme, it is no new Argument, as <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> would haue it; but the concluſion affirming from all gone before, that it is in Gods liberty to ſhow mercy to ſome, as to <hi>Iacob,</hi> and to deny it to otherſome, and that, <hi>Ergo,</hi> he cannot be vniuſt in doing that which he hath liberty to doe. Againe, the firſt part of the Propoſition doth fight with it
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:14192:90"/> ſelfe; for he who may ſhew mercy on whom he will, he may not make the creature the cauſe why hee ſhould ſhow mercy, for he cannot ſhew mercy on any out of his meere pleaſure, &amp; yet ſhew mercy on ſome conſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the creature mouing him to it.</p>
               <p>Now from this that here it is ſaid; <hi>God may ſhew mercy on whom he will;</hi> he gathereth, that God may make a decree to ſhew mercy to ſuch as beleeue, repent, and perſeuere, &amp;c, in ſanctification.</p>
               <q>He who may ſhew mercy to whom he will, he is not reſtrained to ſome perſons, who ſhall be of this or that condition, but is as free to one as another.</q>
               <p>Now the grounds of this new learning, or old er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, I know not which to call it, ſay, that God cannot chooſe any, but ſuch whom he ſeeth eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible, as being qualified with ſuch condition as the iuſtice of God admitteth, which is the moderatrix of his mercy.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>He who can ſhew mercy where he will, can doe more then that which may poſſibly be done, and yet not any receiue mercy.</p>
                  <p>But ſuch a decree as this might be made, and it ſtill poſſible that not one in all man-kinde ſhould be partaker of mercy.</p>
                  <p>He who ſheweth mercy where he will, is the cauſe why mercy lighteth on theſe particular men, rather then others.</p>
                  <p>But he who can but make a decree, that ſuch as will beleeue ſhall haue mercy, he is not the cauſe in particular why this man hath mercy ſhewed to him, rather then another.</p>
               </q>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:14192:91"/>
               <p>His Concluſion miſconſtring that word and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, is aboue refuted, and hath no concord with this Obiection following, which is moſt euident, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>If it be by his meere irreſiſtable will that men be in the ſtate of ſuch as are reiected and hardened, then he hath no reaſon to blame them being ſo.</p>
                  <p>But hee out of his pleaſure, without any thing in the creature cauſing it, doth reiect ſome from mercy, and harden them: <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
               <p>Now Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth anſwere this, either by denying that the will of God is vnreſiſtable, or by denying that the efficacie of Gods will doth reach thus farre, that ſome men are in the number of thoſe who are reiected and hardened; but firſt by rebuking the inſolencie of this fact, that a creature ſhould expoſtulate with his Creator; ſecondly, by ſhowing the right of the thing, <hi>viz.</hi> that God may at his pleaſure reiect and harden ſome: The firſt in the 20. <hi>Verſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>That which the Pot may not doe with the Potter, that maieſt not thou doe to God thy Creator.</p>
                  <p>But the Pot may not finde fault with the Potter, for framing it thus or thus, the end of the 20. <hi>verſ.</hi> Thou maiſt not finde fault with God, as if hee were in fault, by whoſe irreſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtible will thou art in this caſe wherein thou ſtandeſt, rather then thy ſelfe, who doſt ſuffer his vnauoidable pleaſure.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Hauing thus chidden the inſolencie of this
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:14192:91"/> muttering imputation, he proueth that it is equall God ſhould out of his meere pleaſure ſhow mercy to ſome of his creatures, and reiect other ſome, to induration and puniſhment.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>The right which the Potter hath ouer his clay, that and much more hath God in his: for the Potter muſt haue his clay made to his hand; but God muſt create and make the clay which he will worke with.</p>
                  <p>But the Potter hath the power that he may ſeuer certaine diſtinct parcels of his clay, out of his meere pleaſure to contrary vſes. <hi>v.</hi> 21.</p>
                  <p>The Potter doth not ſeuer his clay in this manner, if it ſhall all be fit to receiue ſome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble forme: I will make it to ſuch end, if not, I will turne it otherwiſe; for then it muſt from the clay, not the Potter; why this parcell were a veſſell to honourable vſe, and that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
                  <p>The Concluſion followeth, <hi>ver.</hi> 22.23.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ergo.</hi> ſhall not God haue the ſame right to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point ſome of his creatures to be veſſels of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour, howbeit he vſeth much patience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, that he may the better declare his wrath, and power in them, and his moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious mercy towards his choſen?</p>
               </q>
               <p>The words haue a rhetoricall reticency in them, and are thus laid downe. What if God, willing to ſhew his wrath and power, haue borne with much patience? &amp;c. and that hee may ſhew his glorious mercy towards the veſſels of mercy. Now ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing muſt be vnderſtood: Shall his power for this
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:14192:92"/> be the leſſer? or any plead againſt this freedome of God in denying his mercy, and reiecting ſome, from the great patience hee vſeth toward them: or wee may conceiue it, if not preuenting this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection, yet laying downe the concluſion with a double reaſon, after this ſort: If God haue moſt iuſt ends of his glory, and the good of others who are veſſels of mercy, and if hee execute his decree with much patience, and long ſufferance, towards the veſſels of wrath; ſhall hee not haue power to ordaine them to this end, whom in ſo iuſt manner, and vpon ſo good conſiderations hee bringeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to? &amp;c. In anſwering theſe, <hi>Arminius</hi> ſeemeth very accurate, but it is a wily diligence; ſuch as thoſe poore creatures vſe, which being hard be ſet will run round often, &amp; fetch running-iumps, that by this meanes they may bring to a loſſe all that purſue. To leaue him therefore in impertinent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, what I can gather out of him, touching theſe words, reſpecteth one of theſe three things: 1. The occaſion which went before, <hi>God hardneth whom hee will,</hi> as <hi>hee ſheweth mercy to whom he will.</hi> 2. The obiection. 3. The anſwer.</p>
               <p>Let vs begin with the firſt, for if you marke the antecedent in the ſenſe <hi>Arminius</hi> taketh it, it will not beare the obiection following. Secondly, If the obiection could be made, yet Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> anſwere would proue impertinent; the antecedent occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Arminius</hi> muſt vnderſtand of Gods decreeing to harden, or actually hardening, according to his decree: His decree is, I will deny thee mercy, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den thee, puniſh thee, if through vnbeleefe and
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:14192:92"/> impenitency thou ſhalt make thy ſelfe worthy: His actuall hardning is a powerfull executing this puniſhment of induration, and reiecting, on him who hath by finall impenitency deſerued it: ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe will beare his obiection, with ſhew of reaſon. And becauſe <hi>Arminius</hi> ſeemeth rather to reſpect the decree, we will take vp that, and ioyne this murmuring obiection with it. If I am hardned by Gods decree, which doth ſet downe the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and reiecting of all ſuch who ſhall by finall vnbeleefe and impenitency prouoke him to it, then hath God no reaſon to be angry with me, on whom this ſentence is executed by his vnreſiſtable will: But I am hardned according to that decree. Take the antecedent in the other ſenſe; If God now in his wrath execute induration on me, hauing deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it by my finall impenitency, and that with ſuch power that I cannot reſiſt him, then hath hee no cauſe to be angry with me, who am thus hardned by his almighty power. I doe appeale to any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, what ſhew of reaſon there is, inferring ſuch a conſequence on ſuch antecedents. No, had Gods will beene, not abſolute within himſelfe, but reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting conditions meritorious in the creature, or had his induration beene a meere inferring of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment now deſerued, and not a deniall of mercy which ſhould haue remooued the entrance of the other (which the oppoſition teacheth to be meant by induration) then there had beene no ſhew of reaſon thus to grant againſt God. But come to the obiection: He conceiued in it thus much, as if it ſhould ſay, Can Gods induration cauſe him to be
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:14192:93"/> angry againſt vs who are hardned? Can that which is the effect of his vnreſiſtable will, cauſe him to be angry with vs iuſtly? Firſt, the Apoſtle chideth this inſolency, ſuggeſting the ſtate of the perſon murmuring, and the perſon of God againſt whom it is murmured. Secondly, from compariſon, well hauing thus repelled it, he defendeth the equity of God, and anſwereth to the matter. Firſt in the 2. verſe.</p>
               <q>He who hath power to decree the life and death of his creature on ſome conditions, and ſo to harden ſome, and ſhew mercy to others; If he harden or ſhew mercy, we muſt not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt it.</q>
               <p>But God hath this power ſet downe in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of the Potter: but the compariſon of a Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pleadeth a farre higher thing in God, then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a decree of ſauing ſuch as ſhould become fit through vſe of their owne liberty, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſuch, who ſhould moſt iuſtly deſerue it. For this legall kinde of induration, as ſome of his ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers call it, giueth no occaſion of imputing, with ſhow of reaſon, any fault to God, ſeeing Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree doth not any thing to mee, vnleſſe further then I make my ſelfe a veſſell of diſhonour. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, this ſenſe hath no affinity with the Potters fact, this decree doth not make definitely any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons veſſels of honor, but ſuch of them as ſhould belieue; all if they will belieue: this doth not make the perſons become veſſels of honour, but the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the condition in the decree, this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth God to frame perſons diuerſly qualified, to
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:14192:93"/> diuers ends; whereas the Potter frameth a maſſe all alike to diuers purpoſes. Thus hauing repelled this murmuring, he doth make anſwer to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of their obiection three waies, which likewiſe may make, to his iudgement, a limited reddition of the former compariſon.</p>
               <p>Thus by the way I haue runne ouer part of the ninth to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> in which were not all error a thing connaturall, I ſhould maruell how any could euer imagine things ſo directly againſt the meaning &amp; diſcourſe of it: The plot of his election was as ſtrong in his braine, as numbers in theirs who thought they ſaw them in euery thing. Let vs euer hold that the choyſe and purpoſe of calling to the heauenly inheritance, is meerely from his will, becauſe hee will, without any reſpect to the workes or condition of his creature; framing mankinde to diuers ends, with as much free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as the Potter doth his clay, though it ſeeme to faſten vnrighteouſneſſe on God, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the creature, to fleſh and bloud. It is one thing to doe things with will, another thing to doe them from free pleaſure of will, or becauſe we will onely.</p>
               <p>Againe, the decree is therefore made to depend on God calling, that it may be firme; but did it depend on perſeuerance in faith, left altogether in our liberty, it could not be firme, ſeeing it depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth on ſuch a condition as to the laſt breath is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine, by his owne principles otherwhere deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered.</p>

The reaſon is plaine, God who is wiſedome it ſelfe cannot worke with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an end: A wiſe man will doe nothing but to ſome purpoſe: That which muſt be Gods end, why he maketh all things, muſt be better then all thoſe things which ſerue vnto his end; for the end is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then that which ſerueth for it, as the body is better then foode, raiment, and all things which ſerue for the body. In the third place it is plaine that nothing is better then all the workes of God, beſide God, nothing better then euery creature, but the Creator: If then he muſt needs haue an end why he maketh things, and this end muſt needs be better then the things made for it, and nothing is better then all the creatures, but onely God the Creator: Hence it followeth that God muſt needs haue himſelfe as his end in euery thing which he worketh: now God being ſo perfect, that he needeth not our good, that nothing can hurt him, or make him better in himſelfe: hence it followeth that his end muſt needs be ſome externall matter, as the making himſelf known, that he may be accordingly honored of vs, &amp; that to the benefit of vs who yeeld him this honor. The Scripture intimateth 3. ends in that God worketh toward his choſen. 1.

He that buildeth a houſe, that he may lay a ſure foundation, that he may raiſe the frame, giue it the due filling which belongeth to it, but theſe are not his proper ends, but that hee may haue a houſe for his habitation: So God worketh many things to our glory, and that in vs his Chriſt may be glorious, but the proper end which hee hath in all, is his owne glory.</p>

We ſee that if one doth this or that in wiſdome, he is praiſed for his wiſedome, which in this or that he hath ſhowed: So in any other vertue, thus it is, thoſe things which God doth out of his grace, hee muſt needes intend to haue his grace notified in them, and to haue it, being knowne, admired, honoured, &amp; praiſed accordingly. Againe, thoſe things which God doth out of iuſtice, though, diuerſly iuſtice, from which they come, ſhall be glorious in them, yet all that iuſtice doth is reduced to this, as the iuſt ſupreme end, euen to lend a voice to the riches of Gods glorious mercy, which he ſheweth the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of mercy: For looke as in vs the actions of inferiour vertues, which commend the vertues they come from, they are ſeruiceable in ſome ſort, to actions of ſuperiour vertues, <hi>Ergo,</hi> what my temperance doth vpon the Sabbaoth, it doth it for religion ſake, that my deuotion may more fully and fruitfully occupie himſelfe; ſo would God haue vs conceiue in his diſpenſation, that what his iuſtice doth, it is ſuch, that in ſome ſort it hath a reſpect to, and is ſeruiceable to this moſt ſupreame end, this praiſe of his grace; this is it, in which he moſt delighteth: Euen as vertuous Kings after the matters of God, affect aboue all things to be had in honour for clemencie and bounty; ſo it is with our God, King of Kings, all he doth is to this end, that his grace may be made manifeſt, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his greater glory.

What Lords as it were reigne ouer a man, they are of two ſorts, the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall, or Miniſteriall: The principall is the moſt iuſt God, whoſe iuſtice we haue wronged by ſinne, <hi>ergo,</hi> wee are ſaid to be redeemed from vnder the Law, that is, from vnder the reuenging iuſtice of the Law: Looke as ſubiects taken in murder, rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery, &amp; committed, are the Kings priſoners princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally, not his who keepes them; ſo it is with vs. Miniſteriall, the Deuill and his Angels, the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence accuſing &amp; condemning for ſin. <hi>Act.</hi> 2. Men
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:14192:101"/> are ſaid before their conuerſion to be vnder the power of the Deuill, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. to be taken as beaſts aliue of the Deuill, to his will; not that hee is the principall Lord that hath right in the priſoner, but he is the Iayler and executioner, &amp; ſo the priſoners are his, to keepe them in the dungeon of darkenes, and in the chaynes of luſts of darkeneſſe: Yea God hath put a man vnder the power of his Conſcience, which is as a keeper, continually going with him, and halling him to condemnation, while he is out of Chriſt; and therefore that effect which the ſpirit worketh through the Law, in the Conſcience fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, is called a <hi>ſpirit of bondage:</hi> As amongſt the Romans, priſoners had vnder-keepers, who were chayned arme to arme vnto the priſoner whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſoeuer hee went; Thus doth God, to guilty man his priſoner, he doth ioyne to him his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as a continuall keeper, which though it may be brought aſleepe, yet it ſhall euer be found when God ſhall call, bringing him forth, and witneſſing againſt him.</p>
               <p>For the ſecond: Naturall man hath no ſpirituall liberty to doe any thing ſpiritually good, as he did before ſinne entred, but is led as a ſlaue by luſts, by paſſions, by obiects which pleaſe him, ſo that hee is in a brutiſh bondage: for, euen as the bruit beaſt hath no liberty, but is carried by the appetite to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery thing that doth agree; ſo naturall men, as <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> ſpeaketh, are led with ſenſuality, couetouſneſſe; that looke as one would lead a ſheep with holding out hay or yuie, an oxe with fodder carried before it; ſo doth the deuill natural men, with ſuch obiects

               <p>Naturall mans bondage is, that hee is expoſed to ſuffer a thouſand euils, to weariſome vanity in euery thing, yea through feare of death the vpſhot of euils, he is ſubiect to bondage all his daies, while in that ſtate he abideth, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer put Iſraell to ſuch hard ſeruices, as the Deuill putteth thoſe to, whom he keepeth vnder his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; You may amplifie theſe conſiderations: Hauing ſhewed what it is, and in what it ſtandeth.

               <p>Our firſt Parents by the Deuill tempted, wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly breaking Gods commandement, brought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues into bondage: Now our Parents once in bondage, we that are borne of them cannot be in better condition, till God by his Chriſt, out of his meere grace, ſet vs free: The children you know of perſons in bondage, are all bondmen likewiſe; <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus ſequitur ventrem.</hi>

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:14192:102"/> hee is to be ſlaughtered. Againe, they know, nor think nothing of bondage: When Chriſt told them <hi>If the Sonne ſet you free, you are free indeed;</hi> What replye they? <hi>We are the ſonnes of Abraham, we were neuer in bondage;</hi> Spirituall thraldome could not enter their thoughts. Looke as it was with thoſe men <hi>Eliſha</hi> did leade to <hi>Samaria,</hi> thoſe bands of the Syrians, ſo fareth it with theſe; while the Deuill leadeth them to hell, where they will dye without repentance, ſee themſelues in the midſt of murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſpirits, they follow him as if they went to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen it ſelfe, as thoſe followed, being led with a miſt deprauing their ſight, they followed to the city of their enemies, thinking they had gone to <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> their owne ſtrength: Many ſuch ſoules there are led in this faſhion, who yet will haue the Deuill in their mouthes, and defie him in words, as hauing nothing to doe with him; but as many profeſſe in words that they deny in deede, ſo many defie in word that they doe in worke.

                  </label> Obſerue thirdly, that we haue deliuerance from our ſpirituall thraldome by Chriſt: Chriſt for this is called our Redeemer, or Redemption of his people, who doth deliuer them from the hand of all their enemies, that <hi>they may ſerue the Lord with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feare.</hi> Thoſe whom God did raiſe vp to redeem his people, as <hi>Moſes,</hi> the <hi>Iudges,</hi> &amp;c. yea thoſe who redeemed, as kinſmen, this or that, were ſhadowes of this our great Redeemer, who was in time to be reuealed. Now redemption noteth ſometime the action of God working our deliuerance, ſometime for the effect of this action in vs, who are redeemed and inlarged; thus it is here taken for a ſtate of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which beleeuers attaine through Chriſt his redemption: and this ſtate is twofold; eyther be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne onely in this life, or conſummate, in which ſenſe we haue the redemption of the body, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. and Chriſt is ſaid to be made our redemption after our ſanctification; where redemption noteth out that conſummate deliuerance from the bondage of mortality it ſelfe,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.30. v. the word <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</note> which theſe vile bodies of ours ſhall be brought vnto in heauen: Here he ſpeaketh of the former, which faithfull ones are brought vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to now belieuing: This may be amplified by bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches correſpondent to the contrary bondage; for
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:14192:103"/> from what time we are in Chriſt, we are freed from being vnder the Law, and reuenging iuſtice of God, <hi>there being no condemnation to thoſe that are in Chriſt, Rom.</hi> 8.1. Againe, this ſtrong man is caſt forth, from what time Chriſt the ſtronger entereth; The conſcience is made a ſweete companion and comforter, rather then a rigorous keeper: Being iuſtified by faith we are at peace. Where the King hath releaſed a priſoner, the Iaylor can haue no further power ouer him; for he is but to keepe him during the Kings pleaſure. Againe, by grace, God doth ſet our wils at liberty; ſo that ſinne cannot raign in vs as heretofore, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. Grace which fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth againſt the luſts of the fleſh, and will not let vs come vnder the power of any thing; yea, the world is crucified to vs, and we to the world: For as when health commeth, a man beginneth to walke abroad, and doe ſuch things as he could not ſtirre to, while his ſickneſſe did keepe him vnder; ſo it is here. Finally, we are ſo ſet free, that we can ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer nothing which our wils haue cauſe to be vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with, all things being ſuch, as ſhall worke to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for our good. Count it all ioy when ye fall into temptation, which is the height of freedome, that ſo farre forth as we are regenerate, we cannot ſuffer any thing, though all the creatures ſhould conſpire, but what our owne wils like well of; yea, aske by prayer, in ſome ſort at Gods hand. But it may be obiected, that the diuell doth ſtill preuaile againſt vs, that ſinne leadeth vs captiue, <hi>Ergo,</hi> we are not deliuered. I anſwere, redemption is double either as I ſaid; begun, or perfected: Theſe things
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:14192:104"/> ſtand not with full and perfect redemption, but they may ſtand with it while it is in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings. We muſt diſtinguiſh the power of the diuell, to hold vs vnder condemnation, from his power of moleſtation; and we muſt diſtinguiſh the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of ſinne raigning ouer men, with willing ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection, and vſurping ouer him, as now ſet free, and making reſiſtance.</p>
               <p>In the former reſpects, we are redeemed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered, from what time wee beleeue; the latter, we are ſo ſubiect to, that they ſhall be more and more diminiſhed.</p>

The aſſault of thoſe impure ſpirits for the houre or time, for all thoſe powers of darkeneſſe was then come, when this his redemptory ſuffering approached.</p>
               <p>Chriſt our ſurety, was to take vpon him our debt of death, both corporall and ſpirituall, ſo farre as he might, neither the vnion of his perſon, nor yet the holineſſe of his nature any whit diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: The Scripture doth mention his bloud ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,

               <p>And <hi>Ergo,</hi> as when wee reade that Chriſt was fleſh, we muſt not thinke as <hi>Apollinarius,</hi> that he tooke no ſoule; ſo when we reade his bloud ſhed, or bodily death, wee muſt not thinke that he dyed not a ſpirituall death in ſoule alſo: The fathers, who denyed that he dyed in ſoule, deny it not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, but after a ſort, <hi>viz.</hi> that he dyed not ſuch a death in ſoule, as did deſtroy the eſſentiall life of it, like as death bodily doth the life of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; nor yet any ſuch death as did either ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate his ſoule from vnion with God, or did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply any ſinfull corruption, as it did in vs, whoſe ſoules are dead in ſinnes and treſpaſſes.</p>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> For the firſt, as the ſupreame power of ſauing or deſtroying is with God, ſo of remitting and holding ſinne vnremitted; Wee are therefore to conceiue our remiſſion, firſt of all, as in the gracious purpoſe of God toward vs, who knoweth on whom hee will haue mercy, and whom hee will harden, as we thus had in Gods eternall purpoſe, ſo we haue it giuen vs in time by way of execution; Firſt wee haue it giuen to Chriſt our Head, for vs all; for he being made ſinne for vs, euen as a ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, hauing all our debt layd on him, hee could not be raiſed vp till now all our ſins were done away, <hi>Ergo, Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. ſaith, <hi>That if Chriſt were not riſen, we were ſtill in our ſinnes;</hi> where hee maketh
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:14192:108"/> the cleering of vs all from ſinne, and Chriſt his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, to be accompanied one with the other: Againe, God did reconcile the world, not impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſinnes in Chriſt, which could not be without remitting all their ſinnes for whom his Chriſt did vndertake. Beſides, were not our ſinnes forgiuen in him, we could not be rayſed vp, ſet in heauenly places with him; for before we can haue quickning giuen vs in Chriſt, we muſt haue pardon of ſinne giuen vs.</p>
               <p>Further, what did Chriſt ſhed his bloud for, but that he might actually get the pardon of our ſins? Finally he doth diſtribute nothing to vs, which by vertue of his obedience he receiueth not for vs.</p>
               <p>In the third place this remiſſion is communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from Chriſt to vs in manner following.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Chriſt ſendeth his Miniſters, as Legates, with the word of reconciliation or pardon, inuiting them to belieue on him, that they may receiue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe of ſinne.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He doth worke together by his ſpirit, making thoſe who are his children belieue on him, that they may finde forgiueneſſe in him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hee doth communicate with them the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe which himſelfe had procured and obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for them: Thus euen as condemnation was firſt within the pleaſure of God; ſecondly, Come forth againſt <hi>Adam</hi> and vs all in him; thirdly, is commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated actually from <hi>Adam</hi> to vs, what time wee come to be borne of <hi>Adam:</hi> So on the contrary, our iuſtification or remiſſion of ſinne is firſt with God; ſecondly, in Chriſt, who hath by his obedi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:14192:109"/> obtained for vs the remiſſion of al our ſinnes; thirdly, it is communicated to vs when ſoeuer we are ſupernaturally begotten of him, that is, brought to beleeue: <hi>Hee that beleeueth is borne of God;</hi> for though we haue not iuſtification actually applied before we are called to faith, yet we doe receiue it virtually in Chriſt, when he was quit from all our ſinnes, as it is in <hi>Adam</hi> who was his type; for though condemnation is not actually applied till we are borne of him, yet in vertue his condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was the condemnation of vs all. And by the way, wee may ſee heere how God forgiueth ſinnes, how Chriſt the Mediator, how the Miniſters. God by the principall and prime authority;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>God,</hi> in depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentèr ex autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate primaria: <hi>the Mediator,</hi> ex commiſſione: <hi>Man,</hi> ex mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterio.</note> the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor by a ſecondary deriued authority; Man, by a miniſteriall publication of the word of pardon; for Chriſt doth not miniſterially declare pardon, euen as he is man; for though he be a ſeruant and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect as Mediator, yet hee is ſuch a ſeruant as hath an vnder power of iudgement: The Father giueth all iudgement to the Sonne, he iudgeth none him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: Such a ſeruant as my Lord Chancellor is to his Maieſty, not ſuch a ſeruant as an ordinary or ſpeciall meſſenger in forgiuing ſinnes. Then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it thus, as in citing one to appeare, the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall authority is the Kings, the vnder authority is with the Iudge of this or that Court, the Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall authority in the meſſenger which doth carry and ſerue the Writ; and the meſſenger may be ſaid to fetch ſuch a man vp, not becauſe any autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in him doth it, but the Writ he carrieth, as a ſigne, hath authority to doe it; ſo heere God firſt
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:14192:109"/> pardoneth, as hauing the prime and originall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; then Chriſt as chiefe Iudge vnder God, in the Court of Chancery, that Throne of Grace; the Miniſters as meſſengers pardon, becauſe they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe the word of God, and Chriſt, which giueth pardon, and hath authority to giue it. But this by the way.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond point followeth, concerning the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect of this forgiueneſſe, how farre it is to be exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. I anſwer, it is to be extended to all our ſinnes paſt, before our conuerſions, following after our conuerſions, to the whole guilt or blame, and to the whole puniſhment of them: Wee muſt not thinke that onely ſinnes paſt are forgiuen, but all the ſinnes which ſhall eſcape vs through infirmity; for the couenant of God is to forgiue vs our ſins, and to remember them no more; Now who ſhall limit this to ſinnes paſt before conuerſion, when God ſpeaketh it indefinitely, and when ſuch a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall forgiueneſſe may be, and yet the ſinnes forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen come againe to be remembred? <hi>Col.</hi> 2. <hi>God hath freely pardoned vnto vs all our ſinnes;</hi> He doth ſee no iniquity in his <hi>Iacob,</hi> he to whom things to come,<note place="margin">Iohn 5.24. Hebr. 10. offenders once purged ſhall haue no more conſcience of ſinne.</note> and things paſt are alike preſent; The remiſſion which leaueth no place for condemnation, muſt needs be of all ſinnes: But we being in Chriſt, are ſo remitted, that now there is no condemnation to vs, though we daily ſinne, through the fleſh which dwelleth with vs.</p>
               <q>That iuſtification betweene which and the giuing of eternall life or glorification nothing commeth, that is from all ſinnes: But who ſo
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:14192:110"/> belieueth, hath ſuch a forgiuenes, that he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth eternal life; or is ſo iuſtified, that he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently glorified with the beginning of glory.</q>
               <p>Againe, we belieuing, receiue that forgiuenes of ſinne, which Chriſt hath obtained by his bloud for vs: but this was a full remiſſion of all our ſinnes, from the firſt to the laſt of them: Beſide that, the redemption and righteouſneſſe Chriſt doth bring are euerlaſting, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9. which they could not be if our remiſſion were but of ſinnes paſt; for then ſhould euery conſequent ſinne make vs againe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous, till we were reſtored. If the ſinne pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at our conuerſions be ſuch as cannot be done away without the forgiuing thoſe that follow, then we haue forgiuenes of both; but our ſin dwelling in vs is ſuch that it cannot be forgiuen, but all the reſt muſt be forgiuen likewiſe, for all the other are in it, as an effect in the cauſe, the cauſe as the fruit is in a tree, and the guilt of the corruption preſent reacheth to the laſt ſin, which is to ſpring from it, &amp; <hi>ergo</hi> it is ſure, that when God forgiueth vs this, be doth forgiue vs all other likewiſe, which hee doth ſee are in it, and will in time iſſue from it. Did not God couenant with vs, belieuing, to forgiue all our ſinnes, and ſeale this Grace by Baptiſme, all I ſay paſt, preſent, to come, then wee could not helpe our ſelues in our after fall, by looking to that grace ſealed in Baptiſme, for that was helpfull for the ſinnes committed before it onely, which is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to all good experience and doctrine? Againe, were a man pardoned for ſinnes paſt onely, then muſt we grant that eyther hee may quite fall from
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:14192:110"/> his vnion with Chriſt, or be in Chriſt, and yet be ſubiect to condemnation: And if we had not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſinnes after committed, as well as before, whence commeth it that daily many ſinnes of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity eſcape vs, the peace which followeth our iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, not once diſturbed by them? If any ſay wee haue pardon of thoſe ſins for after, without which none liueth, but not of crimes more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous; this is to yeeld what they pleaſe, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt where they pleaſe, without any motiue from reaſon. Neyther doth that parable teach that God forgiueth vs our ſinnes before our conuerſion, but not ſinnes after, which he doth charge vpon vs at his pleaſure; for the letter of the parable doth, if it be followed, ſeeme to ſound as if God might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire our ſinnes after thoſe ſinnes which before he had forgiuen vs, and ſo did forgiue vs now abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, which the Popiſh ſchoole will not abide by. The Parable therfore muſt be conſtred by the end which it is brought for, <hi>viz.</hi> to teach that ſuch as wil not forgiue, ſhall not find forgiuenes with God; Neyther is that <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. where God is ſaid to be iuſt in forgiuing the ſinnes paſſed before time, through his patience, it maketh not any thing to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; for ſinnes are ſaid to be before committed, which were committed vnder the former teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. it is made plaine, and ſo not the time of a man before and after conuerſion, but the time before and after, or vnder the new Teſtament is there compared: and howbeit wee are ſtill to ſeeke forgiueneſſe, it is not that we are not in ſtate of being iuſtified and forgiuen, but becauſe it is
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:14192:111"/> needfull that God ſhould as well preſerue and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue this, as at firſt giue it; and that this his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ſhould be more and more manifeſted in vs, and that the execution of this ſentence ſhould be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and further performed. Finally, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly chaſtiſements our ſins daily incurre might be preuented; for theſe cauſes we make this petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though we know all our ſinnes are in regard of Gods gracious ſentence remitted to vs: Neyther doth the Churches cenſure excommunicating any argue that hee is one who before the tribunall of God is in ſtate of condemnation, or doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue vnited to Chriſt, but that he hath no manifeſt externall communion with her in the dueties of godlineſſe, and ſecondary operations of the Spirit; yea, that as the Leaper was ciuilly dead in regard of ciuill communion, ſo is hee to her in regard of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall; but ſhe doth take him to haue inward vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and life, which floweth from it; for euen as wee ſeeke the health of none by way of medicine, whom we cannot take to haue life in them; no more can the Church the reſtoring of theſe by this ſo ſharpe cenſure, might ſhe not thinke there were ſome life in them, though it is oppreſſed, as the life naturall by a fit of the Apoplexie. If wee haue not all our ſinnes forgiuen, paſt, preſent, to come, it is becauſe Chriſt hath not the pardon of them all to giue vs; or becauſe the Word and Sacraments cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to vs at once the pardon of them all; or becauſe our faith cannot receiue this plenary remiſſion; or elſe it is not fit for ſome conſequence which would enſue: But the former three none will doubt of,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:14192:111"/> and the latter is fondly ſurmiſed, when this grace which forgiueth, is the parent and nurſe of holy feare in vs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130. Wherefore for this firſt part, let vs aſſure our ſelues, God doth giue vs full par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of all our ſinnes, and that this his gift is, as his effectuall calling without repentance, and we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing, doe receiue this whole mercy: So that though we are ſubiect to grieuous fals after it, and vnbeliefe, yet not to any ſuch vnbeleefe as ſhall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer make the faith of God and his gracious gift in vaine; which, concerning Gods forgiueneſſe, ſo far as they conceiue it to extend, the beſt of the Papiſts Schoole maintaineth.</p>
               <p>Now to ſhow that the whole guilt and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is releaſed.</p>
               <q>Such who are ſet free from all condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are as well ſet free from temporall as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall.</q>
               <p>Now all in Chriſt are thus ſet free, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Such who are ſet free from the curſe of the Law, are ſet free from temporall puniſhments of ſinne; ſuch I meane, as come from reuenging iuſtice, that ſhe may be ſatisfied in them, as well as from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall; for all theſe are the curſes of the Law; ſee,<note place="margin">Iſay 43.

               <p>True it is that God doth after he hath forgiuen a ſinne, take temporary correction ſtill, as in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid;</hi> but to offer himſelfe as a father for our good, is one thing; to reuenge himſelfe as a iudge, for the ſatisfying of his iuſtice is another; the ſting of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenging iuſtice is pulled forth, from what time we haue forgiueneſſe, this done; the euill is no curſe of the Law, and <hi>Ergo,</hi> it may ſtand with full and free forgiueneſſe.

Wiſe ciuill men know that they liue for the good of their Country, and their own priuate; but a foole wanteth this wiſedome. And what doe all naturall men? They ſee not what is the laſt end, at which all their life ſhould aime, as at a marke <hi>viz.</hi> that through faith and obedience they may come
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:14192:119"/> to liue bleſſed euerlaſtingly with God. As a foole iudgeth not of the end to which hee liueth, ſo hee maketh no prouiſion of meanes which tend to the good of other, or himſelfe; and yet ſeeketh after a common-wealth of bables, ſuch as are his dagger, choller, cap, &amp;c. for theſe are as good to him as the Tower of London; So it is with naturall men, they gather a heape of tranſitory things, but lay vp no treaſure in heauen, which might ſtand them in ſtead for afterward. Againe, though fooles are thus poore and miſerable, yet they thinke themſelues to haue all the wit, and haue no ſenſe of all their miſery; for the eye of reaſon is out, with which it ſhould be diſcerned: Thus it is with naturall men, they thinke they know what they haue to do, they feele no want of Grace, they ſee not their miſery which is come on them through ſinne. To reckon vp particulars in this kinde, would be too tedious: Wherefore let vs labour to ſee our ſelues fooles, that we may be made wiſe. It is a ſigne-ſome beam of heauenly wiſedome hath ſhined into the ſoule, which now findeth it ſelfe empty of true ſauing Wiſedome.</p>

               <p>Now for the further vnderſtanding of this point, we who beleeue, may be ſaid to haue all wiſedome; 1. In regard of the excellency. 2. In regard of the quantity. For the firſt, when a man hath one thing ſo good, that it ſerueth him inſtead of all, as if a man hath Gold, Siluer inough, we ſay hee hath euery thing, becauſe he hath that which ſerueth him for euery purpoſe: So though this wiſedome is not for kinde, all wiſedome, yet being ſo excellent that it ſerueth vs to all purpoſes, it may be called <hi>(all)</hi> wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. But here is a further thing to be conceiued, euen in regard of the quantity of it: Now it cannot be ſaid <hi>(all)</hi> in regard that it is abſolutely full and perfect for degree; <hi>for we know in part onely,</hi> it muſt be ſaid ſo then comparatiuely onely: Now it may be ſaid <hi>(all)</hi> wiſedome, thus in a double reſpect; Firſt, in compariſon of that meaſure which was giuen the beleeuing Iew; and thus euery faithfull Chriſtian may be ſaid to haue all wiſedome giuen him: It is a great ſpeech that the leaſt in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God ſhall be greater then <hi>Iohn Baptiſt:</hi> for looke as wee who now are vp after the dawning of the day, and riſing of the Sun, haue far more light, then ſuch who are in the night; thus it was with

For as this earthly vnderſtanding is not in that degree in a childe or yong man, as it is in an aged: So when there are babes, young men, old men in Chriſt, there is a meaſure in wiſedome anſwerable to theſe ages, as it were in Chriſt; but Saint <hi>Paul</hi> here ſeemeth to ſet this downe, ſo as it may admit a common application, rather then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe.</p>

For further vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, it is fit to conſider what things this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening of the Goſpell comprehendeth in it, or how God doth open this ſauing wiſdome to vs. 1. Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, by propounding the doctrine of it vnto our eares, which he doth by his Miniſters: for this

Such as make wiſe,</hi> as it is, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.3. For though it be read, <hi>wiſe,</hi> the word hath an actiue ſignification, and importeth to make wiſe, or bring to wiſedome, as the next word doth not ſignifie iuſt men, but ſuch as turne others to righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe. Euen as in great Schooles, there are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Vſhers, as well as the principall Maſter; ſo it is here: It pleaſeth God by mans outward mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, to open the eyes of the minde, and bring from darkeneſſe to light; but mans teaching, which go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth but to the eare, cannot doe this matter. Wee muſt therefore conſider God ſpeaking within the minde, by holding out ſome ſuch light, and cauſing ſuch an inward illumination, as doth ſpeake things no leſſe to the minde, then a word audible doth report them to the eare. This is it which we are ſaid to heare and learne from the father: ſhould not the father ſpeake and teach, wee could not heare; neither is it an outward voice, for all that heare this voyce come to Chriſt, which is not veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the other: And this is that light, which dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing it ſelfe through the word wee heare, doth make the things of God viſible to the ſoule: Euen as not the ayre alone, but the ayre now inlightned, is the meane by which things are made diſcerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the bodily eye.</p>
               <p>In the third place, we muſt conſider that God doth together with this illumination, which ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth and propoundeth things within the minde; he doth I ſay, together with it, open the eye of the

Againe, there is no ſparke of light in man by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, able to conceiue this ſecret: The wiſedome of the Law, the light of nature reacheth not, for the light of reaſon diſcerneth that God is to be loued and honoured; that I am to doe, as I would be done to, and not after that meaſure I would not receiue; But of ſauing man kinde loſt, by faith on Chriſt, and repentance, there is no light left which can trace any ſtep of this doctrine. Thirdly; the knowledge it ſelfe is of that height, that from what time we haue the ſpirit which doth teach it; wee cannot in this mortality know it any thing as we ſhould, wee ſee but in a glaſſe, know but in part, like Children, which know not fully the things they know: Now that which is hid in ſo great meaſure from vs, who

The Goſpell of ſaluation may be called a <hi>Miſtery</hi> in three regards, 1. abſolutely, becauſe it is a thing of it ſelfe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the will of God, which no creature by it ſelfe is able to know: If a thing within my minde be ſuch, that no creature can know it, further then I make it knowne; none doth know the things in Man, but the ſpirit of Man, how great a deepe and ſecret is that which is within God himſelfe? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Thus it ceaſed when God did firſt reueale it, but yet a <hi>Miſtery</hi> ſtill in regard of the ſpare reuelation, and ſmall number of thoſe to whom it was manifeſted. For a thing is not onely hid while I keepe it in my ſelfe, but while I ſhow it onely to ſome few perſons more neere me, it is a ſecret matter ſtill. If the King ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint ſome two or three of his moſt neere fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites with a ſecret, it remaineth hid ſtill, and a ſecret, in compariſon of things commonly knowne: Thus was the Goſpell a <hi>Miſtery,</hi> when it was made known to the people of the Iewes onely; but continued no longer a <hi>Miſtery</hi> in this ſenſe, when now it was notoriouſly publiſhed to all nations. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, the wiſedome of the Goſpell, is ſtill a <hi>Miſtery,</hi> when it is now diuulged, in regard of thoſe whoſe eyes are not opened to ſee it, and their eares boared to attend to it: as newes ſo common euery where, that they are no newes, are ſtill ſecret to ſuch, who being deafe, haue neuer heard of them; thus it is at this day, a hidden riddle to many Chriſtians by outward profeſſion.</p>

Firſt, wee will conſider of the connexion it hath with the former, then of the meaning and parts of it, and ſo come to the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions which it affordeth: For the dependance of it on that which goeth before, it may ſeem brought in either as an explication of thoſe words in the verſe before, <hi>the mystery of his Will,</hi> or as an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect intended by ſome thing which is in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer verſe reported. The firſt ſenſe is to be taken vp after this ſort; <hi>God hath opened to vs the myſtery
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:14192:126"/> of his will, out of his gracious pleaſure;</hi> Where I meane nothing by the myſtery of his will, but that he meant in fulneſſe of time to gather to head in Chriſt, with thoſe things already in heauen, all things in earth, euen a vniuerſall Church, through the face of the earth: this cannot, as I thinke, be an expoſition of thoſe former words; For to ſay nothing that the Gloſſe is harder then the Text; words which are adioyned by way of conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, are not commonly ſo farre remooued from them they conſter, as you may ſee in the 7. and 13. verſes of this Chapter, and all abroad. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, the Apoſtle by other equiualent termes in the 13. verſe doth open what he meaneth by the myſtery of Gods will, <hi>viz.</hi> no other thing then the word of truth, and Goſpell of ſaluation. Thirdly, that myſtery made knowne; did worke in them all wiſedome and vnderſtanding, made them wiſe in good full meaſure to ſaluation, but the knowledge of this, that God would call and gather to his Chriſt, an Vniuerſall Church in earth, is ſuch a point, in which men made wiſe to ſaluation, were long ignorant, as <hi>Peter</hi> himſelfe. Now then if it be no explanation, then muſt it depend on the former, as an effect intended, and flowing from ſomething before mentioned. Now the matters in the verſe precedent, are but two: Firſt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealing of the Goſpell to <hi>Paul,</hi> with ſome others. Secondly, the gracious good will which God did purpoſe within himſelfe, concerning this benefit of opening his hidden ſauing wiſedome to the ſonnes of men: Some ioyne it with the former, God did
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:14192:126"/> open to vs Iewes and Gentiles the Goſpell, that thus hee might in that full time which he had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, gather to all things now in heauen when he wrote, all the things in earth alſo, euen a Church vniuerſall: But neither would I ſubſcribe to this expoſition. For firſt it taketh the perſons to whom God is ſaid to haue opened the myſtery, to be both Iewes &amp; Gentiles, yea Gentiles principally; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Paul</hi> verſe 12. ſeemeth to appropriate this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of his Epiſtle, from the 7. verſe, to the 13 verſe vnto the Iewes only. Secondly, this taketh that ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of times, to note the fulneſſe of that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſeaſon, wherein God had purpoſed to publiſh his ſauing wiſedome to the Gentiles; but the Text hath it not the fulnes of any certain time, as in <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.3. but the fulneſſe of times indefinitely and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſally. Thirdly, the publiſhing of the Goſpell to all Nations, did not gather thoſe iuſt ſpirits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in heauen, but here they are as properly ſaid to be gathered into Chriſt their head, as the things on earth; as when God is ſaid to reconcile all things in the bloud of Chriſt, as well the things in heauen, as the things in earth, reconciliation doth as properly agree to the heauenly things, as earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, ſo here by proportion; for otherwiſe he would haue ſaid, that he might gather to all things which were now ioyned to their head in heauen, all the things in earth alſo. Laſtly, all in earth, through all times and places were not gathered by that firſt publiſhing the Goſpell to Iew and Gentile, but all who then were ordayned to life through the whole world: Now theſe are not al abſolutely, but
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:14192:127"/> reſpectiuely in compariſon of that few and ſmall remnant which out of our Nation, God ſometime gleaned.</p>
               <p>It remaineth then that theſe words come in, as ſhowing the intended effect which God did ayme at, in his gracious purpoſe of opening the hidden ſauing wiſedome to the ſonnes of men, <hi>viz.</hi> that thus he might in the fulneſſe of thoſe ſeaſons, which himſelfe in wiſedome fore-appointed, haue gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a head in his Chriſt, all things; both thoſe who now were, by hauing this reuelation, gathered in heauen, and all the things which are in earth, through all places and times, to the end of the world. This I take to be the trueſt coherence, both becauſe gathering to a head in Chriſt, is the effect to which God doth deſtinate this gracious purpoſe of opening the Goſpell, and alſo for that this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of opening the Goſpell, outwardly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, or at leaſt inwardly, is extended to euery one, through all ages of the world, who is to be v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited, as a member, to Chriſt the head: ſo that no more, nor fewer haue beene, are, or ſhall be gathered, then thoſe whom God did purpoſe to teach in euery generation. Laſtly, the words fit no ſenſe but this, which to ſhew we muſt ſearch a little the meaning of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, touching the time. Secondly, the thing to be done in time. In the time two things muſt be opened; firſt, what is meant by <hi>(diſpenſation;)</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by <hi>fulneſſe of times. Diſpenſation,</hi> is a word ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from Stewards, and ſuch as haue the keeping of things in common, and are to diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ribute them as
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:14192:127"/> they ſee fit, for ſingular perſons and occaſions: To diſpenſe then, is to diſtribute that I haue in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, as is fitting in wiſedome, to perſons and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in particular.</p>
               <p>Now the diſpenſation of times, is put by a Meton. of the adiunct, for fulnes of times wiſely diſpenſed.</p>
               <p>The fulneſſe of times indefinitely, vnuiuerſally, noting the conſummation of all thoſe ſeaſons ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſciuely, which God had appointed for the gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his children.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> In the thing to be done, marke the Action, that <hi>God might gather to a head in Chriſt;</hi> that is the force of the word. Secondly, marke the Obiect of this action, <hi>all things;</hi> that is, all perſons, who in Gods counſell belonged, as members making that body whereof Chriſt is head. Thirdly; Note the point as it were in which all are to be gathered into one, or vnited in Chriſt, <hi>in him:</hi> Hauing propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the obiect, he doth explaine them by a diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution taken from the place; all things which now are in heauen with Chriſt, gloriouſly conioyned to him; and all who are in earth, that is, who are in all places, and all times, to be gathered to Chriſt in the earth. The ſumme of them is thus much.</p>
               <q>God I told you did open to vs the Goſpell of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, which thing he did according to that his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pleaſure, whereby it pleaſed him to open it to all his choſen, which he purpoſed freely within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that thus by opening his will he might in the conſummation of all thoſe ſeaſons, which his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome hath diſpenſed, that he might <hi>(I ſay)</hi> haue gathered as it were to a head, all things in Chriſt,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:14192:128"/> both thoſe members who had in their times this Miſtery reuealed to them, and are now gloriouſly vnited to him in the heauens: and all thoſe who by meanes of this reuelation, ſhall in all places and through all times, to the end of the world be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vpon earth, as it were to our head in him.</q>

Firſt, when he ſaith, that in the fulneſſe of times which God hath diſpenſed, God will doe thus and thus; obſerue hence, that God hath ſet ſeaſons wherein hee will accompliſh all his purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed will, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3. Hee bringeth out euery thing beautifull in the ſeaſon of it. As he bringeth things naturall, the Spring, Summer, Autumne, Winter, euery thing in ſeaſon, ſo in all the workes he will doe about his children, whether it be the puniſhing of wickedneſſe for their ſake, the deliuering his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren from euils, the giuing them benefits, he will bring them all forth in the fit appointed ſeaſons: The <hi>Cananite,</hi> when his iniquity is full and ripe, ſhall be viſited; <hi>Iſraell,</hi> when 430. yeares expired ſhall be deliuered, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.41. When the 70. yeares are expired, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. Chriſt in the fulneſſe of time, ſhall be exhibited: It cannot be, but that God ſhould both appoint times for euery purpoſe, and execute in them the thing that he hath purpoſed; To deſigne times is his prerogatiue. As a Maſter of a family hath this power, to ſet all times which he will haue this or that buſineſſe taken in hand, ſo <hi>Acts</hi> 1.7.
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:14192:128"/> Secondly; Such is his wiſdome, that he onely know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth how to appoint the fitteſt ſeaſons for all his workes: as the huſband-man, it is his wiſedome or skill in huſbandry, which maketh him know the fitteſt ſeaſons for Earing, Sowing, Setting, Graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and ſuch like buſineſſes. Now looke as mans fidelity doth binde him, if he hath ſaid he will doe this or that, at ſuch a time, to make his word good, and doe it accordingly: So Gods fidelity doth ſo binde him, that he will not but moſt faithfully exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute all that good he hath purpoſed to vs, in the ſeaſons which with himſelfe hee hath diſpenſed thereunto.</p>

Fourthly; wee by being gathered to Chriſt, are gathered to the whole body of Chriſt, to all who exiſt vnder him, by a kinde of pure ſubordination, as Angels are ſpirituall generation from him, as it is in all redeemed by him, <hi>the Angels becomming miniſtring ſpirits for our good,</hi> and wee moſt ſtrictly knit with all both in heauen and earth, already in Chriſt; not onely that wee are vnder one head with them, but we are quickned with one ſpirit, and contained together, as the members of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall body, are both contained and quickned by one ſoule.

<pb n="248" facs="tcp:14192:138"/> of knowledge, and argueth doubtfulneſſe, cannot be aſcribed, but onely ſo farre as it ſignifieth the maturity and ripeneſſe of counſell. Secondly, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell ſignifieth not the faculty, but the effect, wiſe aduiſe giuen in any caſe from that facultie of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome which giueth counſell. Thus we vnderſtand when we ſay; What counſell did ſuch a one giue you? Now thus it is here taken for that wiſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of things, and meanes, which Gods wiſedome ſuggeſted. Laſtly, it is to be conſidered, why it is called counſell of his will. Firſt, becauſe it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to his will; ſecondly, it is accepted of by his will: The meaning is, we obtaine all theſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings before named, hauing beene predeſtinated according to that gracious purpoſe of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs, whoſe working bringeth about all things, according to that wiſe order which his counſell did propound, and his will for the liberty of it did free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accept.</p>
               <p>Now the ſcope of this deſcription tendeth hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to proue that we attaine the benefits before named, hauing beene predeſtinated by Gods coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell (for predeſtination is an act of Gods counſell, as I haue ſaid before) therunto; he proueth this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, by this generall; He who worketh all things after the counſell of his will, hee doth worke theſe benefits in vs, his counſell hauing predeſtinated vs to them; But God worketh all things, &amp;c. Theſe are friuolous exceptions, that God ſpeaketh onely of the things before, which he doth out of his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pleaſure: for this were an impertinent ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluitie, to ſay that God had wrought vs theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:14192:138"/> when his counſell had predeſtinated vs, who doth worke theſe benefits according to his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell; He hath wrought them in vs according to his counſell, who doth worke them according to his counſell.</p>
               <p>Secondly, what ſo euer things are according to Gods counſell, thoſe he is ſaid to worke; for theſe laſt words may as well determine the ſubiect, as ſhow the manner of his working.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, what reaſon is it to ſay, hee worketh theſe things after counſell? as if all the workes of God were not alike after counſell.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, to ſay he ſpeaketh of things he doth out of gracious pleaſure, is in their ſenſe, who except fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolous: for he ſaith not, the counſell of his <gap reason="foreign">

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> Firſt we ſee, that euery thing which commeth about, is Gods effectuall working: <hi>Of him, by him, and for him, are all things, Rom</hi> 11. <hi>vlt.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.6. Things are of two ſorts, good, or euill; good things are naturall, or ſupernaturall, ſuch as are wrought in Chriſt: Now all theſe the Lords efficacie is in making them, yea of nothing: Though man muſt haue ſome matter to worke on, God can giue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and call the things that are not, making them ſtand out as if they were. Secondly, his worke is in ſuſtaining them; Hee doth not leaue theſe
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:14192:139"/> things, as a Carpenter his building, or Ship-wright his Ship, but ſtill is with them ſuſtaining them in the being, receiued from him. That which hath not heate of it ſelfe, but is made hot (as water) with fire, it dependeth on fire to be kept in heate, and no longer then fire is vnder it, it will not keepe hot: So theſe things, not hauing being of themſelues, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on him for their continuall ſuſtentation, who did firſt giue them their being. Thirdly, Gods action is in them, gouerning them to that end for which hee did make them; Things depending on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, are gouerned by that on which they depend. Beſide, our ſeruants depend on vs, to be gouerned by vs; what are all the creatures, but ſo many things miniſtring to him who is the Lord of hoſts? Not to ſpeak that the ſame wiſdome which teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs to get any thing, for this or that purpoſe, doth teach vs likewiſe when now we haue it, to gouerne and apply it to that purpoſe: So Gods wiſedome, which made all things to an end, muſt needes go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne and vſe them to that end: There is no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion in theſe things. For that any thing ſhould beget a thing like in kinde to it ſelfe, it is not ſtrange; and that any workeman ſhould worke any thing like himſelfe, is no wonder; The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie is in euill things: Euill is either of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or ſin; Now God is by himſelfe an author of the firſt; See, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.6. <hi>Is there euill in the citie, which I worke not? Out of the mouth of the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth euill and good, Lam.</hi> 3.38. For, puniſhment though it be euill to his ſenſe who ſuffereth vnder it, yet it is good in it ſelfe, when now it is deſerued;
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:14192:139"/> as to execute a man is euill to him who ſuffereth, good in the Iudge who cutteth off a hurtfull mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber for the good of the publique. Euill of ſinne, is either of the firſt ſinne, or the ſins enſuing. Now theſe, to ſpeake in general, neither of them are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Gods effectuall permiſſion: They who ſo are in Gods power, that they cannot ſin without his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance, his permiſſion is effectuall to the being of ſinne from them, that is, neceſſary to this, that they ſhould actually commit that they are inclined to commit. Now thus it is with God, for he doth ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually worke ſomethings by himſelfe without o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; is the creation of all theſe things; ſome things in and with others, working as inſtruments vnder him and with him; thus he worketh all the workes of grace; ſome things by permitting others, and that when he could hinder them; thus his effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie reacheth to the being of ſinne, and this is moſt iuſt in God; for though euill is not good, yet it is good that there ſhould be euill: God who bringeth light out of darkeneſſe, being able to doe good of euill; and it is iuſt in him to permit, where he is not bound to hinder.</p>

               <p n="13">13. <hi>That which maketh God will the being of ſinne, that he may ſhow mercy in Chriſt, and ſhew mercy in Chriſt for the taking away of ſinne; that maketh
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:14192:143"/> God runne a fond circle. But this doth ſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14. <hi>He who cannot tempt to ſinne, cannot will ſinne: God cannot.</hi> Ergo.</p>
               <p>Now to proue that God did will, that through his permiſſion ſinne ſhould enter, or that hee did will ſinne ſo farre forth as that it ſhould be, or the being of ſinne, (for theſe are one,) the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments following are vſed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He who doth make his creature ſuch who may fall, and ſetteth him in ſuch circumſtances in which he doth ſee he will fall, and then permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him to himſelfe, hee doth will and ordaine that his creature, through his mutability &amp; free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, ſhall fall: But God maketh him ſuch who may fall, and ſetteth him in ſuch circumſtances, in which hee doth foreſee hee will fall, and then leaueth him to fall; <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If any except God, doth make him ſuch as may fall, and ſet him in circumſtances in which he will fall, not that he intendeth his fall, but for his triall, I would, aske why God knowing ſuch circumſtances, in which his creature might poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly haue fallen, not actually falling, and ſo haue proued him without falling, why he did chooſe to ſet him in ſuch, in which hee did foreſee that he would fall certainely?</p>
               <p n="2">2. That about which an act of Gods will is occupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that thing is willed: Gods permiſſion is an act of his will, and is occupied about ſinne, the entring or being of it: <hi>Ergo,</hi> this is willed.</p>
               <p>The firſt part is plaine; as loue, hatred, feare, cannot be about any thing, but the thing
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:14192:144"/> muſt be loued, feared, hated; ſo heere, neither doth man permit any thing, hauing power to withſtand it, but hee is willing with it. Now permiſſion is ſo an obiect of will, that it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe an act of will, conuerſant about that which it permitteth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hee who prohibiting any thing, nilleth it or willeth it ſhall not be, he permitting any thing willeth it ſhall be. But God doth euer nill that which he hindreth.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That which God ſo permitteth that hee hath his end in permitting it, that he willeth; for what euer hath an end, that ſo farre forth is good: What euer in any degree is good, that ſo farre forth is a fit obiect of the diuine will: But God permitting ſinne hath his end, why he will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it, as all grant.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Hee who willeth the antecedent, on which an other thing doth infallibly enſue, hee doth will that which followeth alſo: As God cannot will the being of the Sunne, but he muſt will the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination following it.</p>
               <p>But God willeth to permit, on which infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly followeth the ſinne permitted; otherwiſe God might permit, and the thing permitted not happen, which is abſurd to thinke; for then hee might deliuer a perſon vp to ſinne, and hee not fall into the ſinne into which hee is deliuered: For though the action of free-will come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Gods permiſſion, deliuering vp, and the ſinne to which wee are deliuered and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, yet God doth neuer permit, but that
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:14192:144"/> the creature will fall moſt infallibly to that which is permitted.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Hee who cannot but either will that ſinne ſhould be, or will that it ſhould not be, hee hath willed that it ſhould be: But God muſt either will it, or nill it; <hi>Ergo.</hi> He whoſe omnipotencie is in the being of all things, hee muſt will the being of all things: Gods omnipotencie is in the being of euery thing: for looke as if his knowledge be not in euery thing, he were not omniſcient; and looke as if his preſence were not in euery thing, hee were not omnipreſent; ſo if his powerfull will worke not in euery thing, hee is not omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent.</p>
               <p n="7">7. No defect of an inferiour inſtrument, can trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the worke of an all-knowing and almighty Artificer; For the inſtrument cannot doe any thing, nor yet faile in any thing, without his ſufferance and knowledge: But a defect in an Inſtrument, not intended and choſen by the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificer, doth diſturbe his worke; Therefore <hi>Adams</hi> defection from Gods order, was not without the will and intention of God.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That which maketh Gods prouidence more imperfect toward man is not to be graunted: But to ſay, God letteth man fall into ſinne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his will ordaining it before, doth ſo: For God doth not onely fore-know the euils which befall the baſeſt creatures, but he doth ordaine the falling of them forth.</p>
               <p n="9">9. What euer Gods prouidence worketh to his
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:14192:145"/> will, is to haue that be to which his proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence worketh; for prouidence is ioyned with will, and of things willed: But Gods prouidence doth ſet the creature ſuch circumſtances in which it will ſinne; doth keepe backe all ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall hinderances which might hinder the creature from ſinning, doth intend the vſe of ſinne fallen out, <hi>Ergo,</hi> Gods will was that his creature ſhould ſinne.</p>
               <p n="10">10. That which taketh away the true ground of fearing God, ſolide truſting in him, patience in euill, is not to be admitted: But the opinion that ſaith, that euill may befall vs, which God neither willeth nor intendeth, maketh vs we can neither ſoundly feare, nor ſtay on God: for how can we fully feare and reſt on him, in whoſe hand it is not intirely to keepe vs from all euill, or to bring about all that euill which may ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take vs? Now to ſay that man had power to fall into ſinne without Gods will or intention, doth affirme both theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is out of Gods hand to preſerue vs: For though he will, and intend our preſeruation, yet we may fall into euill: And that euill may befall vs, which God doth not will, nor effectually bring about. I neede not ſhew what a ground of patience is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, when we cannot thinke that God had any will or intention in that which is befal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len vs.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Hee who may holily will and ordaine to good ends and vſes after-ſinnes, hee may ordaine the firſt alſo, and will it as a meane which hee can
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:14192:145"/> vſe to his glory: this is thus ſhewed: After-ſinne as ſinne, hath no leſſe diſproportion with Gods nature, nor can be no more approued by him, then the firſt: It muſt then onely be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects for which God may will an after ſinne, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the firſt; but if reſpects make ſinne a fit obiect of his will, the firſt putteth on as good reſpects as any other: For it was fit the firſt ſin ſhould be to teach the liberty, and withall infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, of the creature, that he might take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of vnfolding his mercy and iuſtice, that his admirable wiſedome, goodneſſe, and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er might be manifeſted, while hee did bring good out of ſuch euill. The aſſumption: But God moſt holily willeth and ordaineth after-ſinnes; As for example; the vniuſt crucifying of Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.28. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.23. None are blinde like ſuch as will not ſee: For to ſay that God would not that his Sonne ſhould be killed by the Iewes procurement, and the hands of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, but onely that God would haue him deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered into their hands, to ſuffer what God would haue him to indure, is but an eſcape of a turne-ſicke braine, blinded with wilfulneſſe; for what is it but to ſay, God would not that his Sonne ſhould be killed by them, but giuen into their hands that he ſhould be killed by them? for it was death, euen the death of his croſſe, yea, and that vnder the hands of ſinners, that God did lay vpon him to ſuffer: Neither doth it help, to ſay, they were now refractory ſinners; for if ſinne in one, now a wilfull ſinner, doth by
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:14192:146"/> reſpects it hath and vſes, become a fit obiect for Gods will to will and ordaine; then the ſinne of a creature defectible may be ordained alſo.</p>
               <p n="12">12. That in which is Gods counſell, in that is his will and worke; But Gods counſell reacheth to the being of ſinne, otherwiſe ſinne ſhould fall out God vnaduiſed. The propoſition is in the Text; His counſell is accepted by his will, and hee doth worke effectually after ſome man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that which his will alloweth, and counſell aduiſeth.</p>
               <p n="13">13. That which is a truth, muſt needes haue ſome former truth, a cauſe why it is true; and ſo there is no ſtay till we come to the firſt truth, cauſe of all truth: But that ſinne is a truth, <hi>Ergo.</hi>

               <p n="14">14. If there were but one fountaine of water, there could not be any water which were not thence deriued: So there where is but one fountaine of being, what euer is found to be, muſt needes thence take the originall, ſo farre forth as it is exiſtent.</p>
               <p>Hauing heard what chiefely is brought in one iudgement and other, we will lay downe theſe concluſions for way of anſwer, to thoſe Arguments which were firſt laid downe, oppoſing the truth in this Queſtion, as I take it.</p>

                  <head>
                     <hi>Concluſion</hi> 1.</head>
                  <p>God cannot poſſibly ſinne: Hee may worke beſide his rule who may ſinne, Gods rule is his moſt iuſt and wiſe will, which he cannot but
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:14192:146"/> worke after, no more then he can deny his owne nature; <hi>Ergo,</hi> he cannot ſinne.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God cannot be author of ſinne, in and with his creature, as he is of euery good word and work; for that which the creature doth, God being the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and principall worker of it, God muſt informe the manner of it by his commandement, and work it in him by his ſpirit: But it is impoſſible for the creature to ſinne in working after that which is commanded him of God, <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. God cannot ſo farre will ſinne, as to approue it for good in it ſelfe; it hath no proportion to his nature, ſuch as he cannot be author of in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor yet the creature worke while it keepeth communion with him. Wherefore God cannot allow it as good in it ſelfe, though he hath liberty whether he will puniſh it thus or thus; according as he doth with freedome reward ſuch things which he cannot but approue as good, ſuch obedience to his Law had his creature obeyed.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Though God cannot will it as good in it ſelfe, nor approue it as good, yet he may will it ſo farre forth that it ſhall be, as being able to worke good out of it; God might haue willed that none of theſe things ſhould haue beene, which had agreement with his nature, and <hi>Ergo,</hi> by proportion may will that ſuch things ſhall be, which diſagree in ſome ſort from his nature: For though theſe things are not good, the being of them is good to him who can vſe it to his glory. Gods efficacy, <hi>Ergo,</hi> reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not to the Eſſence, but to the being and beginning of ſinne: For though the will of
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:14192:147"/> man doth make ſinne exiſt immediately, yet the will of man could not doe it, did not the will of God giue way by his permiſſion. I ſee Theeues comming to robbe, and ready to enter at ſuch a doore, I haue power to ſhoote the boult and locke it, ſo that they could not enter; notwithſtanding hauing company about me to take them at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, I leaue all, that they may freely enter and take ſome bootie, that ſo I may come on them, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend them, and bring them to their deſerued end; in ſuch an example, though the vniuſt will of theſe men did immediately make this robbery exiſt, yet I doe make it exiſt more principally then they, in as much as they could not haue done it, had not I giuen way to them; yet how beit I am a cauſe why this robbery is committed in this place, and at this time, in which I could haue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, yet am I no cauſe to them of commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Sin, though it hath an outward diſagreement, ſuch as may be in a creature from the Creator; yet it hath no inward poſitiue repugnancie or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riancie to Gods nature, ſuch as is twixt fire and water: Euen as the good created, though it hath an outward agreement with, and reſemblance to the creator, yet it hath no inward agreement, ſuch as is twixt nouriſhment, and a thing nouriſhed, for then ſhould the diuine nature inwardly in it ſelfe be better for the one, and worſe for the being of the other, and ſo ſhould neceſſarily will the one, and nill the other. Againe ſinne, though as ſinne, it hath an outward diſagreement, and be euill in the
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:14192:147"/> nature of it, yet is it not abſolutely euill to God as it is ſin, but to the inſtrument ſinning, in as much as God can make ſin, as it is ſin, ſerue to diuers good vſes. No wonder then wicked men can vſe Gods beſt things to euill.</p>
                  <p>Sinne, as ſinne, God can turne to an occaſion of his glory; for not permiſſion, but the thing permitted, is it which God doth take occaſion by, to giue the promiſe of the Mediator; He can vſe ſinne, as ſinne, for a puniſhment, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.14. Becauſe they did prouoke him by adolatry, he did puniſh them with giuing them vp to buggery: Theſe lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſinnes were not puniſhments, in regard they deſerued further puniſhment and condemnation then the former, yea, a further deſertion of God; but in regard of committing theſe acts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: Had God by conuerſion preuented further deſertion and condemnation in one of theſe idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, now come to maſculine filthineſſe, his idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try euen in this act once exerciſed, ſhould haue beene puniſhed. The ſinfull reſpect in this fact is more penall then deſertion or puniſhment follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after. God may vſe ſinne as ſinne, for exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his children; The cup of ſuffering God reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs, is to be ſinfully and iniuriouſly handled; God would haue Chriſt not onely dye, but ſuffer being innocent, an vniuſt condemnation, yea, the ſinfull manner of afflicting is heauier to Gods children, then the affliction it ſelfe. Beſide that, in many of their exerciſes, it is not the act which doth or could afflict them, but the ſinne of the act; not ſpeech from <hi>Shemei,</hi> but ſinfull reuiling ſpeech
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:14192:148"/> was <hi>Dauids</hi> exerciſe. Wherefore being not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely euill, but good to God in regard of the vſe of it, he may ordaine and will it as good, or rather the good vſe of it.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Though Gods will and worke may be in ſinne, yet it is not alike in the ſinne which his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in innocency may fall into, as it is in regard of that ſinne which he may fall into when now he is for ſtate ſinfull.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. God may furniſh forth his creature, ſo that he may <hi>per ſe,</hi> and yet may <hi>per accidens,</hi> make de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and hee may will that his creature ſhall ſinne, being ſuffered to it ſelfe, by accident of it own liberty and vertibilitie.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Or hauing made his creature, ſo that when he may obey, he will in ſuch and ſuch circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces take occaſion and willingly and wittingly ſin; God may decree to ſet him in ſuch conditions in which he will ſinne, and leaue him without putting any impediment, which in effect is to will that ſinne ſhall be by his permiſſion.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. God may doe that which may directly bring a ſinner to commit ſinne, as he may ſmite him with blindnes in vnderſtanding, with prauity; for as death bodily is a good ferne in the nature ſinful of things, though not good to a liuing perſon, ſo is this blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, prauitie, hardneſſe of heart, good in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, though not good to man, who ſhould be conformable to the Law, and free from them; good as inflicted, not as contracted and receiued. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; God may ſuſpend all actions which in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree tend to hinder. Thirdly; God may prouoke
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:14192:148"/> by occaſions of finning not onely ſet things, which he may take occaſion to peruert. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of all is, it were iuſt with God to conſummate ſpirituall death vpon his creature now ſinfull, and <hi>Ergo,</hi> much more lawfull to execute ſuch a degree as is inferiour.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Concluſions premiſed, the Arguments vſed for defence of the negatiue part, may be more eaſily anſwered, then many of thoſe for the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatiue.</p>

                  <p>To the firſt, it is denied that it is either cruelty or iniuſtice in God to ordaine that the creature ſhall fall through it owne wilful defection, and ſo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his iuſtice in deſerued puniſhment: to conſtrain the creature and make it ſinne vnwillingly, and yet to determine to puniſh it, were to puniſh it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe, as delighted with cruelty. Secondly, I anſwer, as much may be obiected againſt their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion: That which is cruelty and iniuſtice, not befalling ſauage men, that is farre from God; But to ſet his childe, neuer hauing offended him, in ſuch a taking, in which hee doth ſee hee will certainely make away himſelfe, and not to hinder him when he might euery way as well doe it, and that with ſpeaking a word, is cruelty and iniuſtice, farre from ſauage men: Now all this, different Diuines confeſſe of God. Firſt, that he did ſet him, being euery way yet innocent, in ſuch circumſtances. Secondly, that he could haue hindred him by ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſting ſome thought effectuall to that end. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that if God had thus hindred him, mans will
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:14192:149"/> ſhould haue beene no leſſe free, and Gods primary purpoſe ſhould haue bin more promoted. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that God determined, notwithſtanding all this, he would permit him fall: Reuenging iuſtice can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be glorious but in iuſt puniſhment; iuſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment cannot be, where there is no iuſt merit on the creatures parts; iuſt merit there can be none, if the creature doe not wittingly and wilfully ſinne againſt God from the voluntary counſell of it, <hi>ergo,</hi> as God will haue the end, ſo hee cannot will the creature ſhall ſinne, otherwiſe then from the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full defectibility of it.</p>

The Law may bring vs to feele our ſelues dead, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. but it cannot quicken any: Though when the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell hath now quickned vs, it may inſtruct vs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme vs, yea, delight vs in the inner man, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. many things may helpe vs, when now wee liue, which could not be meanes of reſtoring vs from death to life. But it may be obiected, the Goſpell is ſaid a ſauer of death, as well as the Law is ſaid a a killing letter. I anſwere. The Goſpell is ſaid ſo, not that directly the nature of it is to kill, but by accident of mens corruption who reiect and will not obey it, it turneth to their further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation:
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:14192:156"/> As the Kings pardon cannot kill any by it ſelfe, yet deſpiſed by a malefactor, it may double his guilt, and bring him to more haſty and fearefull execution: So the gracious pardon of God, offered in the Goſpell, killeth not any by it ſelfe, ſaueth many who receiue it, yet deſpiſed, it may by occaſion worke heauier death and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. But the Law doth of it owne nature hold a man now in ſtate of ſinne, vnder death and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, and cannot of it ſelfe bring any to life, who now hath offended; <hi>The words I ſpeake to you</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>they are ſpirit, they are life:</hi> Euen as the body of the ſunne, diffuſeth as an inſtrument, the beames of this materiall light; ſo it is the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, that inſtrument of God, by which hee ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth out the light of his gracious ſpirit into our hearts.</p>

                  </label> And here, before wee paſſe to the generall Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; note from this, that the Goſpell is called, the word of truth; that all Gods promiſes made in Chriſt, are true and faithfull; <hi>They are Yea, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. <hi>They are true, and worthy all entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 15. The whole word is true: For like as the witneſſe is, like is the teſtimony or depoſition which commeth from him: Now God is faithfull and cannot lye; but this is attributed to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel, as agreeing to it, with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine excellency before other parcels of the word: For the Goſpell is ſometime called by generall names, as a doctrine of godlineſſe, a Law, a Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; Sometime it is deſcribed by the author, the Goſpell of God; ſometime from the obiect, the Goſpell of Chriſt, of the kingdome; ſometime from the property, as an eternall Goſpell, a good word, a true word, as here; ſometime from effects, as in the next words, a Goſpell of ſaluation. Now it is teſtified to be a word of truth, after an eminent manner, for three cauſes. Firſt, it is occupied about Chriſt, who is the truth and ſubſtance of all the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes legall, which now are vaniſhed. Secondly, the truth of this word is further confirmed to vs then the truth of any other, by word, by oath, by the teſtimony of the great Apoſtle Chriſt Ieſus, by a iewry of ſolemne witneſſes, choſen for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, by a multitude of miracles. Thirdly; this
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:14192:157"/> property is the rather annexed to this Doctrine of the Goſpell that thus our vnbeliefe might be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen; for our minde is corrupted with errour, prone to any vnbeleefe, but hard to beleeue theſe points ſo high aboue the naturall reach and apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it. Now as a Phyſitian doth ſay of his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, that it is excellent, not that it needeth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations, but that he may induce his Patient the better to take it; So God and his Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours doe teſtifie of theſe things, that they are true, that wee might thus be brought to yeelde them beleefe.</p>
               <p>But it may be obiected, that word which bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth many reprobates beleeue the forgiueneſſe of their ſinnes, and life euerlaſting, that is not a word of truth; but the Goſpell doth ſo. The reaſon of the former propoſition is, becauſe that which bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth me beleeue a lie, cannot be true; but to bid a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate beleeue his ſins are forgiuen, is to bid him beleeue a lye. The ſumme put together, commeth to this; That word which biddeth a man perſwade himſelfe of that which is vntrue, that is a lying word.<note place="margin">To beleeue that my ſinnes are now pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned me, and that I am ſaued; this is not the firſt act of faith, but followeth them when now a man doth ſee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in Chriſt.</note> Firſt I ſay, this may be denied, vnleſſe I bid him perſwade himſelfe ſo, with a minde of decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing him. <hi>Abraham</hi> by Gods command was bound to perſwade himſelfe that <hi>Iſaac</hi> was to dye vnder his owne hand, yet was not that a lying word, by which God ſpake to him, becauſe the intent of it was butto proue him: Some ſay he was bound to thinke ſo, vnleſſe God ſhould countermand and reuerſe his former command. Anſ. <hi>Abraham</hi> did abſolutely beleeue it; and <hi>Ergo,</hi> did not comfort
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:14192:157"/> himſelfe, by thinking God might call backe his former precept, but by conſidering that God could raiſe him from the dead: Much more may God bid the reprobate belieue this or that, while hee doth it but to euince their contumacy, and doth ſee well how farre they are from belieuing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch matter.</p>
               <p>Secondly I anſwere, that the ſecond part of the firſt reaſon is not true; God doth bid them belieue on Chriſt to forgiuenes of fin, he doth not bid any reprobate directly belieue that his ſin is forgiuen.</p>

Looke what a ſeale ſet on any thing doth, it agreeth well to belieuers: For firſt a ſeale maketh ſometimes things ſealed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret; Thus the graces of the ſpirit make belieuers vnknowne to the world, who haue not receiued the ſame ſpirit with them, yea ſuch as none can or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily know their happineſſe beſide themſelues: <hi>My loue is like a fountaine ſealed; for this cauſe the World knoweth you not, becauſe it knoweth not the Father,</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.2. Secondly, a ſeale doth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh; thus the belieuers are a peculiar to God,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:14192:160"/> are ſet apart; as the firſt fruits of the creature, are taken out of the world. Thirdly, A ſeale doth make things authenticall: Thus meaſures, cloathes, deedes, any thing by the ſeale comming, is confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and warranted in the kinde of it: Thus belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers they haue that giuen them which doth fully aſſure their ſaluation alwaies, yea, which doth not onely make it ſure in it ſelfe, but ſometime put it out of all doubt with them, that they can ſay, they know whom they haue belieued, and that hee is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to keepe their ſaluation they haue truſted him with to that day. Looke as Kings when they take any to great offices, or to haue &amp; hold lands, mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of inheritance heere or there, they giue their ſeale, that they may the more ſecure it vnto them; ſo doth God to vs, when now hee taketh vs belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to that heauenly inheritance. But it may be obiected by many belieuing hearts, wee finde no aſſurance, but much doubting euer and anone, though wee hope wee haue and doe truely belieue. <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is one thing to haue this or that ſurely by deed and ſeale confirmed, another thing to know that we haue a thing ſo ſealed: As men in earthly things may haue ſure euidence for this or that, and yet not alwaies know the certainty of their hold, and ſo doubt cauſleſly, thus it is in belieuers, they haue their redemption euer ſurely ſealed, but not knowing the certainty hereof in themſelues, they are yer-while ſubiect to doubtings.</p>

<pb n="292" facs="tcp:14192:161"/> ſay, whom he ſealeth to redemption.</p>
               <p>Now, that both Gods ſpirit and this image of God in vs, doe as it were ſeale vs vp to ſaluation, is plaine.

Had wee great matters to be conueied to vs, though all were concluded, and the inſtruments ready drawne, yet wee could not reſt till we had got all ſure ſealed; ſo it is with vs, we ſhould not reſt, but ſeeke this holy ſpirit, that we might ſee our heauenly inheritance ſafe and ſure, euen ſealed within vs.</p>
               <p>Secondly; We ſee by this, that the ſeale is Gods holy ſpirit, that God doth not intend by ſealing, to make our ſaluation certaine in it ſelfe, but to vs alſo: For he who ſealeth vs with ſuch a ſeale which we may know, hee would haue vs aſſured in our ſelues, touching that to which we are ſealed: But the ſpirit may be knowne of vs; for that which is a ſigne manifeſting other things to vs, muſt need<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Whether wee may in ordinary courſe be infallibly perſwaded touching our ſaluation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The truth is, Chriſtians may come to it: That which is ſufficient y confirmed on Gods part to Chriſtians, and that whoſe confirmation may be ſufficiently receiued on Chriſtians part, concerning that they may infallibly be aſſured; but God hath ſufficiently confirmed it, as is plaine by his Word, ſeales, oath, pledge, &amp;c. and what God offereth or confirmeth ſo, we by faith may receiue it; for faith doth inable vs ſuffi iently to belieue that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealeth to vs: Now his wil to ſaue vs, by all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is particularly reuealed, as wee ſhall ſhow fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hereafter. That which maketh vs vnable to haue ſound ioy, hearty thankefulneſſe, courage to proceed in a godly courſe, that is contrary to the truth: But to take away this certaine perſwaſion of our inheritance doth this: How can I ioy in a thing which I know not whether I ſhall haue it or no? I
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:14192:163"/> meane with ſound and full reioycing? How can I be thankefull for that which I know not whether euer I ſhall get it or no? How can a man haue heart to proceed, while he cannot know whether he is in a courſe right or wrong, and cannot tell whether all hee doth will come to any thing yea or no? To explane the truth more fully, I wil open theſe foure points. 1. What this certainety is. 2. On what grounds it riſeth. 3. In what ſtate the faithfull at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it. 4. That the ſence of it may alter euen in thoſe who haue attained it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This certainty is no other thing then the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of a renewed conſcience, which doth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe through the ſpirit, that wee are in ſtate of grace, and that we ſhall be brought by God to life euerlaſting. I call it a teſtimony of the conſcience, for the conſcience doth not onely ſhow vs what we are to doe, what ſtate we ſhould ſeeke to get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, but it doth witnes &amp; giue iudgement about that we haue done, and the ſtate we ſtand in, be it good or euill. The conſcience accuſeth of ſinne, and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth to a man that hee is in the ſtate of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; it doth witneſſe to a man that hee is in ſtate ſubiect to Gods temporary diſpleaſure, and ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that a man is in ſuch ſtate as that God will ſhew him fauour for the preſent, and bring him to ſee his promiſed ſaluation: That it is a teſtimony of our ſpirit, that is, our conſcience renewed, it is plaine, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. That our ſpirit doth witneſſe it, through the ſpirit witneſſing our ſtate vnto it, is plaine in that place: alſo, <hi>The ſpirit of God doth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with our ſpirit;</hi> and <hi>Rom</hi> 9.2. <hi>My conſcience

To which I anſwer, comming to that ſecond ground, by a gift of diſtinction or vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, wee know theſe things wrought in vs by God, and by diſcerning theſe things, wee are aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red touching that full ſaluation promiſed to vs. Firſt, that wee may know them, then that theſe knowne doe further aſſure vs: <hi>Paul</hi> did know on whom hee had belieued; How could we ſay euery one we belieue, if we might not know it? Can we ſpeak that truly wherof we can haue no certainty? Thirdly, when I ſee one, or truſt to any, promiſing me this or that, I know I ſee him and truſt to him, reſt on him for that he hath promiſed: Shall I by faith ſee Chriſt the Sonne, and reſt on him, and yet know no ſuch thing? Wee may know wee haue ſome kinde of faith, but not that wee haue the true liuely faith. <hi>Anſ.</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> bids vs, to <hi>try and proue our ſelues whether wee haue not that faith, by which Chriſt dwelleth in our hearts,</hi> which is the faith of ſuch as are accepted with God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5.6. Now to bid mee make ſearch and examination for that
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:14192:165"/> which cannot be found out, were ridiculous. Our loue to God and our brethren, by which we know our ſelues tranſlated from death to life, wee may know alſo. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Iohn</hi> maketh it a ſigne of our being tranſlated; <hi>Ergo,</hi> it may be knowne. Signes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſting other things, muſt themſelues be more manifeſt. Secondly, hee that may know hee hath true, faith, may know a <hi>priori,</hi> that hee hath loue alſo: for loue is in true faith as the fruit in the root, from which it ſpringeth: We loue God when now wee haue found that hee loueth vs firſt. Now by faith we perceiue God to beare vs loue, &amp; be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, for God doth offer his loue to mee belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing. Againe, if I loue men, I know my loue to them, yea, and in what degree I beare them loue: Shal I loue God to the denying of my earthly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, yea my life often, and not be able to know that I loue him? Were this true, when Chriſt asked <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Loueſt thou me,</hi> he ſhould haue anſwered, Lord, thou knoweſt wee cannot tell truely whether wee loue thee. Againe, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, <hi>By this wee know that we loue him, if wee keepe his commandements:</hi> If any ſay we know that we haue a naturall loue, but wee are not ſure that wee haue this Chriſtian loue. Againe, many Chriſtians thinke they haue true loue, yea <hi>Peter</hi> himſelfe was deceiued in his loue. <hi>Anſ.</hi> The loue of a meere natural man to God, is as like Chriſtian loue, as an apple is like an oyſter; and therefore we paſſe by it. Chriſtians are eyther en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened onely, and not ſanctified, or ſanctified al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo with their enlightning: The former may thinke themſelues to haue loue, not hauing it; but becauſe
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:14192:165"/> a man dreaming, or running vpon ſome miſtake, may be deceiued, ſhall this preiudice, but that a man waking may iudge truly of this or that which is before him? A man that hath no charity, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelfe to haue it; therefore one that hath it, may not iudge infallibly that he hath it? Now for thoſe that haue it as <hi>Peter,</hi> they may be deceiued, not in iudging ſimply of the thing, but of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of that which is circumſtantiall in their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall life, not in that which is ſubſtantiall. <hi>Peter</hi> was not deceiued in thinking that hee had faith and loue, but in preſuming aboue his meaſure. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, wee may know our workes, which are fruites growing from the tree of grace in our harts. S. <hi>Iohn</hi> maketh them ſignes which doe euidently declare loue, <hi>ergo,</hi> they are manifeſt. Hee who knoweth when he doth ſinne &amp; ſwerue from obeying God, hee may know how farre hee obeyeth God; they who doe ſpiritually obey God, eyther they know it, or their conſciences are not priuy to that they doe, cannot beare witneſſe and iudge of that they doe; but this is falſe. <hi>Pauls</hi> conſcience did teſtifie to him, that hee did walke in ſimplicity, according to the Grace of God. True it is, that for the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, the works of vnſanctified men are like to the workes of the ſanctified, but they are without the life and ſpirit which is in the worke of a true belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, to which he is no leſſe priuy, then to the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall worke which commeth from him. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude; they who haue the teſtimony of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, may know that they obey God ſincerely: But Chriſtians may haue the teſtimony of good
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:14192:166"/> conſciences. Beſide that, the ſpirit doth teach our conſciences to beare witneſſe of the griefe and ioy we haue, and ſo by conſequent of all wee doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to good. Now the conſcience as through faith ſo diſcerning theſe things, doth teſtifie to vs from theſe our ſaluation, which he hath promiſed, and God will not forget to finiſh what hee begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth. Should a King promiſe to erect ſome Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and giue liberall maintenance to Students in it, wee are certaine by a humane faith, that hee will doe ſuch a thing, though it be not begun; but when now the foundations were in laying, then we ſhould not onely belieue his purpoſe, but in part know it by that we ſaw executed, and by that we ſaw in execution, wee would aſſure our ſelues the thing ſhould be finiſhed. But heere it will be obiected that though knowing theſe things wee might come to ſee our ſelues in preſent ſtate of grace, yet we cannot be ſure of our ſaluation, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe wee could know that our faith, loue, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, ſhould perſeuere to the end. To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that the Scripture could not ſay that he that belieueth hath an euerlaſting life, that there is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt, did it not take our faith and the fruites of it to be ſuch, from which wee ſhould neuer fall, through the power of God; and this the conſcience commeth to know by faith in God, conceiued through ſuch promiſes as theſe; <hi>I will make you walke in my commandements; I will put my feare in you that you ſhall not depart; I haue begun my worke, and I will perfect it in you; I am author and finiſher of
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:14192:166"/> thy faith; it is my will thou ſhouldeſt haue eternall life, and be raiſed vp at the laſt day.</hi> Now though the conſcience doth teſtifie this our preſent being in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, and our future ſaluation; yet it doth not this in euery ſtate of a belieuer. For firſt there is a ſtate in which faith is a ſmoaking weeke, deſiring that it could belieue, rather then getting vp to feele it ſelfe belieue. Againe, though faith be not troubled, but doth quietly ſtay on Chriſt, and taſte God good in letting them finde peace with him, yet ſuch is the infancy of ſpirituall vnderſtanding in Chriſtians now firſt conuerted, that they doe not returne into themſelues, and iudge of that they doe, and of the great conſequence which followeth from that which they doe. Hence it is that they will tell you they finde God good to them, and goe on cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in duties for the preſent, but they come not to behold the ſtability of their ſaluation for time to come. There is a ſtate in which faith is exerciſed with temptation, from vnbeliefe or otherwiſe, by which oppoſition the ſoule is kept from attaining this certainty, being encountred with doubtful ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, which it cannot wel anſwer &amp; cleare for the preſent. There is a ſtate wherein faith is now grown vp, &amp; either hath out-wreſtled, or otherwiſe is exempted from knowing ſuch temptation; and the faithfull in this ſtate doe perſwade themſelues, that Gods mercy, and truth, and power ſhall carry them through vnto ſaluation. Looke in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 11. <hi>The God of Grace, who hath through Chriſt called you vnto eternall glory, when you haue a little ſuffered, he perfect you, ſtabliſh you, ſtrengthen you, ground you ſure.</hi>

               <pb n="304" facs="tcp:14192:167"/>
               <p>Laſtly, when now our conſciences are come to teſtifie through faith and experience, this happy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, we are ſubiect by neglecting meanes, by fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into ſome more grieuous ſinne, by ſecret de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſertions ere-while to loſe for a time this comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perſwaſion, the ſpirit not ſpeaking in vs by his light as heretofore, and our conſciences and faith ſo hurt and wounded, that the actions of them are troubled, depraued, as we ſee the like befall the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall reaſon and ſenſes. Wee ſee through melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly what reaſon commeth to imagine, how the eye thinkes it ſees things yellow and redde, when they are nothing ſo; the taſte things bitter, when they are ſweet; ſo the ſight of faith and conſcience, when nothing but ſinne, guilt, wrath, angry de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion ouer-lay it, it ſeemeth to ſee euery thing, for the time, of like colour to thoſe things wherewith it is poſſeſſed. Theſe things I thought good to ſet downe, that we might conceiue the nature of this point more fully. One thing is to be anſwered which ſeemeth to me of greateſt moment, namely, that this doctrine doth leaue no place for feare, but breedeth preſumption; but this is vtterly denied: for the grace and mercy of God belieued, breedeth loue of God, and conſequently true feare, which is oppoſed to ſenſeleſſe ſtupidity and carnall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, though it caſteth out feare, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from vnbeleefe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſuch who may be certaine of ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by faith, they may be ſecure, if they did not as well ſtand in this grace by faith, as firſt enter into it; but this wee teach with the Scripture, and <hi>ergo</hi> our
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:14192:167"/> doctrine doth ſhow that thoſe who ſee this Grace, haue ſtill need to looke to Chriſt the author and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſher of it, that they may ſo ſtand in it vnto the end.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is falſe that ſuch as are ſure of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion haue no cauſe to feare, vnleſſe no other euils but finall damnation need to be feared; but while the ſoule is ſubiect to bring vpon it Gods tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary wrath, ſickneſſes ſpirituall, helliſh anguiſh to the ſenſe of it, there is ſtill left cauſe enough to feare.</p>

Further to open this point. 2. Things muſt be ſhowed; firſt what faith in Chriſt, or on Chriſt is; ſecondly, why faith as it iuſtifieth and ſaueth, is carried to Chriſt onely: Faith on Chriſt, is not onely to know, and with the eye of the minde to ſee that God ſent his Sonne, that he was borne and ſuffered for man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde; but to reſt or ſtay on Chriſt, that we may finde mercy in him, to the forgiueneſſe of our ſins; to ſtay on him; for faith is not onely a knowledge in the minde, but a godly affection in the will, which doth goe to, embrace, reſt vpon Chriſt, or the grace offred in Chriſt, <hi>Ergo,</hi> receiuing is made an effect of faith, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.12. and going to Chriſt, <hi>hee that beleeueth, hee that commeth to mee, Iohn</hi> 6. and the nature of faith is deſcribed by words which ſignifie to roule our ſelues on God, to leane on him, as one would ſtay himſelfe vpon a ſtaffe; for the word of promiſe, not onely containing truth but offering ſome good thing vnto vs, we cannot fully receiue it with vnderſtanding, but the will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo muſt moue toward it.</p>
               <p>Againe, let me be diſtreſſed for a hundred pound, or ſo, if one promiſe me I ſhall haue it of him, I doe not onely know and thinke, and perſwade my
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:14192:171"/> ſelfe he ſaith true; but I truſt to him, reſt on him, and write as we ſay, on that hee hath ſpoken. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, if there were no particular confidence in a Chriſtians faith, the reprobate might haue all that is in his beleefe. Now though our faith beleeue many other things, yet it iuſtifieth and reconcileth vs to God, as it doth ſee and reſt vpon Chriſt: As a malefactor, though his hand will receiue innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable matters, yet as it receiueth the Kings par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don onely, it doth acquit him and reſtore him to liberty; ſo it is with vs condemned ones, as our faith receiueth Gods pardon in Chriſt, it doth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine remiſſion of ſinne, and ſet vs free from feare of damnation. The matter obiected, may eaſily be anſwered, if theſe two things be remembred. Firſt, that when the words of knowledge doe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by connotation imply affection, much more doe the words of beleefe, and <hi>Ergo,</hi> where I finde to beleeue that Chriſt is the Sonne of God, I muſt conceiue this beleefe, to containe confidence in the Sonne. Secondly, to remember that when faith of any temporary promiſe is ſaid to be accounted for righteouſneſſe, it is becauſe it doth in beleeuing the thing temporall, apprehend him in whom all the promiſes are <hi>yea, and Amen;</hi> who is at leaſt the remoued obiect of a iuſtifying faith in euery thing it apprehendeth. Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> beleeuing the promiſe of ſeede of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> did apprehend that bleſſed ſeede which had from the beginning beene promiſed, and ſaw his day, which the Apoſtle doth teſtifie, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. Neither did he looke at the power of God, but to ſuſtaine his beleefe of a ſeede before
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:14192:172"/> promiſed, againſt the temptations wherewith God did exerciſe him; that we haue a particular word, and in effect to beleeue on Chriſt vnto forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes, I haue ſhewed aboue.</p>

In nature we ſee nothing can moue in deſire to this or that, till firſt it hath apprehended it loue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: So our affections cannot in loue and deſire moue to, and vnite themſelues with God, till by faith wee doe diſcerne him as reconciled to vs, &amp; ſo becomming an amiable obiect for vs ſinners to imbrace; till that faith diſcerneth this, nothing but wrath, like a conſuming fire abideth ouer vs. Hence it is that Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> maketh loue to

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> To the firſt I anſwere, not all ceaſing, but cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing out of vnbeliefe, or impenitencie is ſinfull; firſt, when we haue obtained this or that, we may ceaſe to begge any longer as we did before: Euen as the body reſteth when it is now come to the place to which it moueth; ſo the ſoule when it hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned that, to which it went by vnfained deſire. Secondly, when we finde the thing not to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for vs, or otherwiſe not pleaſing to God. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> was taught to ſee the vſe of that buffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting remaining with him: Thus when <hi>Ieremy</hi> lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that God had not to giue, nor would not be intreated for the proſperity of the people, hee did deſiſt, though hee did well before in asking of it: for that reuealed will, and not the ſecret is that to which our actions muſt be conformed: Though here is ſomthing extraordinary in theſe examples, yet God doth often let his children ſee that they did affect things not good for them, by leading them into fuller knowledge of their owne hearts, and by letting them finde the fruit of ſome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward diſturbances, the remoouall whereof they ſought earneſtly, ſo that they correct themſelues, and no more ſeeke to be free from that which they finde ſo neceſſary by good experience: this deſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is holy and good. Thirdly, there is a deſiſting ouertaking Gods children, when God doth locke vp their hearts that they haue not power to ſeeke the good of ſome perſons or Churches as heereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they haue done, which when it is not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:14192:176"/> or cauſed by ſome ſinfull indiſpoſition in the party, but from a ſecret of God not moouing the ſpirit in this kinde, that ſo way may be made for his iudgements, it is ſuch a ceaſing as cannot be condemned for ſinne, though it may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be bewailed, as a ſecret deſertion, which doth foretell heauie things inſuing. Fourthly, Wee ceaſe to pray as before for things, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſinne, when now God hath, as it were, ſpoken within our ſpirits, that wee ſhall haue the thing we haue asked, and bid our ſoules after a ſort returne to reſt: For from whence we find God thus good vnto vs, wee follow not with our accuſtomed fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uency, though execution delayed, may cauſe vs ſometime ſeeke the ſeaſonable performance of it, the ſoule is more in ioyfull expectance, leſſe then before in carefull petition. The ceaſing therefore forbidden is, when before we receiue things, we doe through vnbeliefe and impatience, giue ouer either for a time, which befalleth Gods children, or alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The latter queſtion is anſwered thus.

               <p>The Vſe is to ſtirre vs vp that wee faint not in

               <p>

               <p>Obſerue ſecondly from hence, that he doth pray that they might know their hope, the matter of their inheritance; that euen true beleeuers know not at firſt, in any meaſure, thoſe hopes which are kept in heauen for them: Naturally we know nothing of the hope to come; When God doth now rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate to theſe hopes, we doe know them in ſome
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:14192:183"/> meaſure, but nothing as we ought, and may come to know them, if we be not wanting to our ſelues: Euen as earthly heires in their minority, through want of earthly wiſedome, they know in generall that they haue inheritances, &amp; where they lye, but they doe not particularly and exactly know the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall Lordſhips which belong to them, the worth of them, &amp;c. yet the neerer they come to age, the more they winde out ſuch particulars; ſo it is with vs: Wee doe at firſt know things very confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly, and the neerer wee grow to our ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the more wee come into the vnderſtanding of theſe things.</p>
               <p>Now the reaſon why theſe hopes are not ſo knowne, is partly in the excellency of them, and the glorious light which is in them; if the Law hath his wonders in it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.18. what a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull thing is this, which is the vpſhot of all, the Goſpell?

Bring the light of a candle neere to the naturall babe, and it cannot endure to looke vp againſt it. Thirdly, euen as children are ſo taken vp with their childiſh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, that they cannot bend themſelues to the more ſerious conſideration of more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant matters; ſo beleeuers are a great while ſo car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally affected, that they cannot ſet themſelues to purpoſe about this contemplation.

As no man can hope to ſtand before a mortall Prince in place of dignity and office, till the King doe call him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; ſo none can groundedly looke to be in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious condition in Gods kingdome, till hee haue called him hereunto. Here briefely it ſhall not be amiſſe to conſider what this calling is. 2. How we may know that we are effectually called.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, this calling is ſuch a reuealing of his grace within our hearts or mindes, as doth make vs come to him and follow him for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of life through Chriſt: As a man hath both a foule and a body, ſo this call ſtandeth not onely in the outward word, which ſoundeth in the eare, but that inward reuelation which God maketh within the heart; <hi>I will ſpeake to their hearts.</hi> The heart of <hi>Lydea</hi> was opened. Secondly, I ſay it
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:14192:185"/> maketh vs come and follow God for obtaining life and glory, to which he hath called vs: for God ſpeaketh inwardly &amp; outwardly to many, who are not effectually called, becauſe God doth not intend to conuert them and make them follow; but this calling, according to his purpoſe, is neuer without effect: It is with vs in this call, as it was with thoſe Chriſt called to follow him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.20. hee did ſo reueale his will within them, that they preſently obeyed.</p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, it is ſeene by this, that it maketh vs ſeparate and ſtand out from the world, If a gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour call out a ſeruant to doe this or that, he is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from all his fellow ſeruants, and ſet a part for a buſineſſe wherein they intermeddle not; ſo it is here; From what time God doth call vs vnto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, he doth ſet vs a part from all others, to be as it were <hi>the firſt fruits of his creatures, Iam.</hi> 1.18. euen from prophane perſons, ciuill men, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out religion, religious men in ſhow, without pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Heretickes, Schiſmatickes, his calling doth make vs come out from theſe, ſo that wee cannot be of one heart with them, nor they with vs.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, by the ſpirit receiued; When God called
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:14192:185"/>

<pb n="354" facs="tcp:14192:192"/> is inclined agreeably to the diſpoſition of it, to come vnto God: ſo that the more full anſwere to this queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> what is all that effectuall helpe whereby I come to God, is this: It is a mixt thing ſtanding partly of that almighty power of his, put forth for my good, partly of that word <hi>outward</hi> and <hi>inward, by</hi> and <hi>with</hi> which his power is put forth; partly in that ſpirit of faith, and ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall life, which his almighty power through his word bringeth forth in my ſoule. What was that helpe whereby Chriſt made <hi>Lazarus</hi> able to come to him, out of the graue of naturall death? The principall was Chriſts power almighty; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentall, his voyce; the formall cauſe imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately helping to it, or working it, was the ſpirit of naturall life, which the power of Chriſt by his word, reſtored to this dead corps, which now was fallen. And thus you haue the effectuall helpe or grace, by which we come actually to conuert; for that Gods power put forth to worke good for vs, is a helpe giuen from his free grace, or his free fauour toward vs cannot be doubted, when the Scripture euery where maketh him our helper, from his meere grace. If we lend our arme or hand to helpe one, being no way tyed to it, it is a helpe giuen from our free fauour. That his call, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or outward, and habit of grace, wrought in vs, may be fitly called grace effectually helpfull to the acts brought forth by them none denieth, though all will not haue habit needfull to our firſt couerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And this firſt thing is well to be noted; for from hence wee may gather in what ſtandeth the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:14192:192"/> of Grace, effectuall to conuerſion, <hi>viz.</hi> In Gods effectuall power, put forth to execute his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention which he hath of conuerting ſome actually before otherſome; it doth not ſtand in any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity or temperature of Grace, correſpondent to our Nature; for this doth argue that there is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly an incorrupted, a connaturall diſpoſition to receiue grace. This maketh the effect of conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to depend as much on the actiue capacity of the will, as on the Grace of God; nay more: for it maketh the Grace of God worke it morally and externally, and the will of man from a power with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it ſelfe, which doth more inwardly enter the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of conuerſion then the other, as hee who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwadeth mee to giue an almes, is not the cauſe of it ſo eſſentially as I am, who out of my pleaſure giue it vpon his firſt motion.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> To the ſecond I anſwere, that God doth vſe ſo to worke our comming to him by beliefe, that he doth firſt for the moſt part prepare vs thereunto: As before we engraffe a Sience we cut it and ſet it for inciſion; and if a timber logge lye ſunke into mudde, men ſet to their tacklings firſt to draw it out of the mire, before they lay it on Cart to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it away: Thus God doth by his power often worke ſome preſeruatiue change in a ſinner, before he doth by his power and word worke the ſpirit of faith in them, and make them come to him. Thus God by afflictions is ſaid to boare the eare, and to prepare to conuerſion. When <hi>Manaſſes</hi> was hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in great miſery, he ſought the Lord; Thus by conuiction of ſinne they were pricked in heart, and
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:14192:193"/> ſaid, <hi>what ſhall we doe to be ſaued?</hi> and then ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receiued the Goſpell belieuing: ſometime by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary terrors, riſing from external accidents, yea, hidden naturall cauſes; thus the Iaylor was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, and <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe by an extraordinary viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was brought to great aſtoniſhment: ſomtime by reſtraining, giuing common gifts which make men for degree neerer, that is, in their kind and ſtate not ſo much remoued, as others in the ſame ſtate and kinde with them: Thus Chriſt ſaid to the young man, who was rich and vnconuerted, <hi>that hee was neere the kingdome:</hi> Nay, God may by giuing a man vp to height of ſome ſinne, or ſinnes, prepare one to Conuerſion, as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> the one left to perſecuting, the other to thoſe horrible out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages; that looke as Phyſitians by ripening diſeaſes make way to heale them; for ſicke matter is neuer more eaſily brought away, then when it in ripenes and quantity exceedeth. Concerning this matter, for our better vnderſtanding, let theſe concluſions be remembred.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that theſe preparations are not abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary, for wee ſee that God doth giue to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants ſanctifying grace, in whom none of theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratiue operations can take place.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we do not finde that they haue been alwaies vſed, and therefore this matter is to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood as a thing moſt commonly falling forth, not otherwiſe: How was <hi>Mathew</hi> called? euen at his cuſtome, hee followed preſently, not as <hi>Iudas,</hi> but as a true conuert to Chriſt; ſo in <hi>Lydia:</hi> for life &amp; death being ſuch contraries as haue no third thing
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:14192:193"/> betweene them, which doth partake in them both, the one may be changed into the other, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing preparatory.</p>
               <p>All things which God doth prepare to the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of Grace, and comming to him, they make not of themſelues any thing to the introducing of Grace further then God intendeth this effect by them: Feare of hell, conſcience of ſinne, neuer ſuch afflictions, morall parts, and all gifts which may be without ſanctifying Grace and true beliefe, many haue all theſe, who yet neuer turne vnfeignedly to God. When the ſickneſſe is now growne greater in quantity, this abſolutely taken, maketh the patient further of health. But the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian may intend this, becauſe he doth ſee his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine will the better worke on it, and educe it, when it is growne to ſuch ripeneſſe. If a man fall out of a dead Palſie into a light Phrenſie, phrenſie of it ſelfe is no paration to health, but to the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian who can worke on him more fitly in this ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king then in the other, it may be a preparatiue to health: Thus to be like an aguiſh man on his good dayes, or like to ſome madde men in the time of their intermiſſions, is in it ſelfe as farre from ſtate of health, as otherwiſe; but yet the Phyſitian may vſe ſuch a ſtate, as a way to health, chooſing rather to deale with him in this taking, then in the fitte. Thus it is not the height of ſinne; it is not feare of hell, though contrary to the Apoplexie of deep ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity; it is not a morall courſe, which commeth not from true ſanctification, that of themſelues can make neerer the ſtate of grace, but only in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:14192:194"/> of God, who doth intend to turne them here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. Thus if God ſtirre vp a man to liue accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the light of nature virtuouſly, it may be in regard of Gods intention, a preparing him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue further Grace of effectuall vocation; but all a man can doe from naturall ſtrength, of it ſelfe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth nothing.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that where effectuall raiſing vp the hart to faith beginneth, there Gods preparatiue workes take an end: for as that which prepares the ground for ſeed, now ceaſeth when the ſeed is to be ſowne; ſo all theſe things, which as they are preparations doe nothing but fit the ſoyle of the heart for Gods effectuall calling to be giuen, they haue their end when this immortall ſeed commeth to be ſowne in vs: beſide that, a man is no ſooner called, then hee receiueth a ſpirit of faith, by which hee is, as by a new heauenly forme, in ſome manner quickned.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, The Papiſts doctrine is heere very defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue, and falſe in part; Defectiue, for they ſpeake nothing of preparatory courſes, by which God doth bring vs to come vnto him by faith, but of ſuch like operations by which God prepareth vs, and we prepare our ſelues to be iuſtified: Now we prepare our ſelues to iuſtification, when the ſpirit doth without any habit of Grace, lift vs vp to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall acts of beliefe, hope in God, loue, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for ſinne, and feare of hell; in which many things are erroneous; as firſt, that they make vs lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vp to acts of this nature without habits, which is to make a blinde man ſee without giuing his eye new ſight; to make vs bring good fruits while yet
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:14192:194"/> we are not made good trees; to make vs be iuſtified by our faith, come into grace by our faith, ſtand in grace by another. The ſchoole not vnderſtanding the doctrine of preparation, conſider of it philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phically, as a thing betweene Nature and Grace. Now betweene the things we worke out of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſtrength, and thoſe we do meritoriouſly from Grace now infuſed into vs, and inherent in vs, they deuiſe a third kinde of workes, which neyther come from any power of ours meerely, nor yet from any ſupernaturall Grace inherent in vs; and theſe are workes done by eternall ayde of the ſpirit; whereas all the Scripture make that faith which is required to iuſtification, to be the ſame with that which wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth by loue; to be a faith fully formed, comming from a ſpirit of faith, that is, an habituall guilt wrought by the ſpirit; to be a faith belieuing on God, which the beſt pillars of popiſh learning con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe to be an act of formed faith. Beſide, they erre when they make feare of hell a thing immediately diſpoſing to iuſtification, when the work of this is to mooue vs to ſeeke out of our ſelues after ſome word of faith, and this is caſt forth proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly as faith and loue enters: It may prepare to our conuerſion, not to our iuſtification immediately. Againe, when they make loue actuall to goe before iuſtification, whereas loue doth follow; For we loue becauſe we haue found loue firſt; now no loue is felt from God till remiſſion of ſin and acceptance to life in ſome meaſure are felt &amp; perceiued: ſhould God lift vs vp to loue him before his iuſtification, he ſhould by making vs loue him, prepare vs to be
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:14192:195"/> loued of him; <hi>Shee loueth much, becauſe much is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen her.</hi> In a word, ſetting aſide the act of a true faith, comming from an inward gift of the ſpirit, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining the heart to belieue, there is no other thing preparing to iuſtification immediately; where this is, there together in time, iuſtification is receiued; there the ſpirit of loue and hope are not wanting; <hi>Hee who belieueth, is paſſed from death to life:</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe, wee doe long after, not feele our ſelues iuſtified, nor perceiue Grace to dwell in vs ſo ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and manifeſtly as wee deſire. Hence it is that ſometimes wee are in feare, ſometime belieue, hope, ſometime we are in repentant ſorrow, and by theſe wee are led both to the manifeſt perceiuing of that which is wrought in vs, and to the more full mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Peace and Grace, which we much deſire.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond queſtion then; In what order Gods power doth bring vs to belieue, is thus anſwered; That moſt commonly hee doth in ſome kinde change vs, and make vs more fit, that ſo his word may be reuealed in vs, which accompanied with his mighty power, doth bring forth that ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall habit of faith, by which he doth incline vs to moue vnto him.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Now for the third thing; Whether this help doth leaue the will at liberty actually to reſiſt it, yea or no; the anſwere is, it doth not: That which the omnipotency of God is put forth to worke in the creature, that the creature cannot reſiſt: But God putteth forth his omnipotency, and by the effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all working of it, he may bring vs to beleeue. The firſt part is not denied: The ſecond is here plainly
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:14192:195"/> ſet downe, <hi>viz.</hi> That God doth bring vs to beliefe by the effectuall working of no leſſe power, then that which raiſed Chriſt from the dead.</p>
               <q>That which maketh Gods aide and Grace put vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of man, and not mans will to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, that is a Pelagian hereſie: But to ſay that notwithſtanding Gods helping Grace, man may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, is to put Grace in mans power, not to put mans will vnder the power of Grace.</q>
               <p>For the firſt part of the reaſon we may ſee it;<note place="margin">Aug. de haereſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus. <hi>88.</hi>
                  </note> for <hi>Pelagius</hi> taken vp, becauſe hee yeelded nothing to Grace as hee ought, granted that hee did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre it before the will, but put it vnder the power of it. That which maketh man able to fruſtrate Gods counſell touching his conuerſion is not to be granted: But power to reſiſt all God can work, maketh him haue power to fruſtrate Gods counſel: Indeed it would be thus in power of the creature to make God periured in the things he hath ſworn. To the ſecond part of this reaſon ſome may happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie anſwere, that this power maketh not man able to reſiſt God becauſe hee doth in his counſell de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree nothing, but ſo that hee doth ſee this power is ready infallibly to performe it: But this is nothing that God doth ſo will and decree that he knoweth the creature will not reſiſt him; for this doth infer no more, but that God ſhall not miſſe of any thing he willeth: it doth not proue hee may not, but it abhorreth from Chriſtian eares to ſay there is any power which may poſſibly make God a lyar, as well as to ſay, God ſhall not be found true in that he hath ſpoken.</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="362" facs="tcp:14192:196"/>
                  <p>That which is wrought in the will, not from any naturall power of ſuffering, but from the obedience in which it is to Gods almighty power, that the will hath no power to decline:</p>
                  <p>But the worke of conuerſion to God is wrought in it, from the obedience in which it ſtandeth to Gods almighty power.</p>
               </q>
               <p>To vnderſtand it, things haue a power of ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, from their natures, inclining them to ſuffer this or that, as waxe is naturally inclined to melt with heate; or a power which cannot but obey ſome agent working on them from without; thus a peece of wood may be made into an image. Now in regard of God, all things are in ſuch a ſtate of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, that they will come to any thing he will bring them: A ſtone by this power may be made into a man, euen a Sonne of <hi>Abraham.</hi> Now that which things ſuffer from this power, whereby they obey agents working on them from without, that they cannot auoyd: for euery thing ſo far as it is come in obedience to another, ſo far it cannot reſiſt. Now, that conuerſion is wrought in the will, as it ſtandeth onely in obedience to Gods power, is plaine; for it hath no naturall inclination to ſuffer any thing, both for the being and manner of it, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue nature: For there is no naturall power in an eye now blinde, to receiue ſight, which is not in it ſelfe, but onely in regard of the manner in which it is to be reſtored, a thing ſupernaturall: How much leſſe in the eye of the minde, now become darkenes, to receiue the light of ſauing knowledge, which is euery way a thing both for matter and
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:14192:196"/> manner ſupernaturall vnto it? Beſide, if there were a power naturall to receiue conuerſion, then there muſt be ſome agent in nature able to worke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion; for there is not found a power naturall of ſuffering in any thing, but that wee ſee alſo in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a correſpondent power working vpon it: Wherefore the will, not from any naturall inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it hath, ſuffering this worke of conuerſion, muſt needes ſuffer it as it is in obedience to Gods almighty power. Now to ſay it may reſiſt, as it is in obedience, is to ſpeak things contradictory: The Scripture doubteth not to ſay in effect, that Gods will of predeſtinating, calling, and ſhewing mercy to ſaluation, is vnreſiſtable; <hi>Who hath reſiſted his will? Rom.</hi> 9. and if it were needfull, it might be ſhewed, eſpecially out of <hi>Tertullian</hi> &amp; <hi>Auſtin,</hi> that Gods grace hath the free-wil vnder the power of it. Out of <hi>Auſtin,</hi> That God by his omnipotent power inclineth wills whether hee willeth, hauing them more in his power then we our ſelues; that his grace doth help vs <hi>indeclinabilitèr &amp; inſeparabilitèr;</hi> which is all one, as if he ſhould ſay, it doth helpe our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, not only infallibly, but irreſiſtably; That it is not reiected of any hard heart, becauſe it is giuen to take away that hardneſſe of heart which might reſiſt. The will of the creature is the neceſſity of things on Gods decree, neceſſity followeth, this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor is ſuperfluous to my intent. But it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected, that this doth take away the liberty of the will in conuerting, if the will he not able to doe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe; for that which the will doth, not hauing power to doe otherwiſe, in that it is not free.
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:14192:197"/> I anſwer with limitation, that which doth not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing power to do otherwiſe from change in ſecond cauſes compelling it ſo to do, in that it is not free: Otherwiſe, when this neceſſity commeth from Gods almighty will by himſelfe determining of it; for this doth ſo ſweetly determine the creature, that the power of it is no way changed or dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed; as the omnipotent will of God doth ſo in the falling out a contingent thing, as the not breaking Chriſts bones, as that the nature of contigencie in regard of all ſecondary cauſes, is no whit impay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. I anſwere ſecondly, that this opinion doth ground the freedome of will falſly; for the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of wil, as it is a faculty voluntary or electiue, doth not require this indifferency of exerciſing the act of it diuers waies, for the conſtituting of it. To cleare this the more, conſider that liberty may ſeeme to ſpring from three rootes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, from this indetermined indifferency, whereby the will is free, nothing determining it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, as well to mooue it ſelfe to a diuerſe thing, as to that whereto it moueth. Secondly, In regard of the flexibility which is in the habituall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, which might bend as eaſily to another diuerſe thing, or to ſuſpend, as to moue whereto it moueth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in regard of flexibility, which is in the habituall inclination, which might bend as eaſily to another diuerſe thing, as to that whereto it goeth. Thirdly, In regard of the iudgement, which doth goe before the act of it, iudging freely of it, as a thing which it is able to doe, or not to doe, or if it
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:14192:197"/> come into compariſon with other, iudging of it as a thing to be done before other, and ſo mouing to it. Now this I take to be the true root of liberty, whence actions are ſaid free, becauſe wee out of a free iudgement moue about them for to do a thing or ſpeake thing, thus or thus, out of iudgement thinking it free, or determining one, when it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidereth a diuerſe thing which it might doe alſo, this maketh the action free; yea ſo free, that it is done with election: For though the thing I worke be neceſſary in regard of Gods will which hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined it, yet I worke it freely, while I doe it out of ſuch a practicall iudgement going before. As a man, though hee ſpeake things for the matter of them neuer ſo true, yet while he ſpeaketh out of a iudgement that the thing is falſe, hee ſpeaketh falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, though the thing ſpoken be otherwiſe true; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth God maintaine a falſe iudgment in man, becauſe his iudgement of other things free to him, is with this limitation in him for ought hee know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and to doe any thing from my will with iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that it is poſſible for mee in ſome ſort if I would to doe otherwiſe, is enough to free wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. To place the freedome of the iudgement in iudging, the meane we vſe indifferent, ſuch as may be vſed &amp; not vſed, &amp; yet the end attained, which I like not, becauſe Chriſtians cannot eſteeme and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of faith, repentance, as meanes indifferent, when neuertheleſſe they beleeue and repeat freely.</p>
               <p>Now though the will was in creation, and is in Chriſtians inclinable to contraries, yet I doe not thinke liberty to ſtand in this natiue flexibility,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:14192:198"/> which is inclinable hither or thither, much leſſe in liberty of exerciſing power to or fro, as being here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in by no power predetermined. For firſt, the will ſeemeth to be ſaid free in regard of ſomething no way bound but the indifferencie of the inclination in exerciſe are bound by Gods decree, ſo that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be done; but what hee hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in men diſtracted in reaſon, the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent flexibility of will is not altered, the exerciſe is no more phyſically predetermined then before, and yet they worke not with liberty. Thirdly, were liberty in the flexibility, then the more our wills were flexible to things oppoſite, the more perfect were our liberty. Whereas wee ſee Chriſtians, the more they grow in grace, the more their inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe to ſin is diminiſhed; and when they haue attained perfection this flexibleneſſe to euill ſhall be totally remoued.</p>
               <p>The firſt opinion muſt be more neerely ſcanned. Many will haue liberty nothing but ſuch a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, whereby God hath made his creature euery way vndetermined, ſo that when hee doth any thing, hee hath full power to doe the contrary, or to ſuſpend. Now though this freedome might be defended againſt whatſoeuer is in any ſecond cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> in this ſenſe, that hee is free to exerciſe his power as well another way as this hee moueth, for any thing that any creature can doe in heauen or earth, nay, for ought he can ſee in himſelfe alſo; But to hold this abſolute in regard of God himſelfe is a moſt prodigious conceit. Liberty in this ſenſe,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:14192:198"/> accidentality, contingency, neceſſity, theſe are modalities agreeing to effects, as effects are in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their ſecond cauſes, not to God who moſt certainly, neceſſarily, and wiſely hath willed them. Fire burneth not neceſſarily to Gods power, who can at pleaſure change it, or reſtraine the ſecond act of it; nothing falleth out accidentally, as refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to him whoſe wiſe intention reacheth to euery thing: So for contigency alſo, and liberty in the ſenſe before named. But it ſhall not be amiſſe to ſhew ſome reaſons why this is to be reiected.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That which exempteth a creature from being as an inſtrument vnder the power of God, is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd; but this doth ſo. It is proued thus, that which giueth the creature a power to doe as he wil, when God hath done all hee may vnto him, that doth make him no inſtrument ſubiect to Gods power: But this opinion doth ſay, when God hath done all he may, the creature is free to do as he will. Some are not aſhamed to ſay that God doth not worke out of his omnipotency in the free will of the creature; otherſome are not aſhamed to ſay, that euen in workes of grace, the will is not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tearmed an inſtrumentall cauſe vnder God: ſome deny the aſſumption &amp; proofe of it, becauſe this power came from God, and is ſuſtained by him, and he can doe what he will in man. But to this I ſay, a thing communicated &amp; maintained to me by another, is that it is: So this power though giuen &amp; maintained by God, yet is a power exempt ſo farre, that hee may not by any power ouer-rule it; and though God can doe what hee will, yet it is
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:14192:199"/> one thing to be able to doe a thing by perſwaſion, which I may refuſe, another thing to doe it by pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which I cannot refuſe: This latter by this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is denyed.</p>
               <p>That which taketh away Gods infallible preſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, is not to be granted, but to ſay the wil of man is free no way determined doth ſo: for knowledge is meaſured by the thing to be known, and therefore when the thing to be knowne is euery way vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, euery wher indetermined, knowledge cannot be certain. The ſecond part of the reaſon is denied; for they ſay, that God by a kind of knowledge doth ſee what a free creature now made wil do, if he be ſet in ſuch &amp; ſuch circumſtances.

So to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes, he doth conſter it, the ſetting Chriſt in the throne of maieſtie, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3.8.1. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. <hi>At the right hand of the throne of God.</hi> Saint <hi>Peter</hi> maketh it all one, with making him Chriſt and Lord; See, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.35.36 <hi>Ch.</hi> 5.31. But for the further o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening, we muſt know. 1. What it is that is giuen. 2. To whom, and in what reſpect. 3. How long it is to continue. To the firſt, I anſwere, that it is not the might of diuine ſoueraigntie ouer the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for this doth ſo follow the nature of God, that it is neceſſary with euery perſon that hath this nature: This the Sonne could not relinqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſh, this he cannot be taken vnto, as which doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily agree to him, as God bleſſed for euer. What is it then? A right of executing immediately and in a manner appropriate to this perſon, the ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne dominion of God, ouer euery creature: So that though the Father and Spirit haue a right and ſoueraigntie ouer the creature, yet they doe not immediately execute this in ſuch ſort as the Sonne doth; which maketh Chriſt ſay, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.22 <hi>The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther iudgeth none, but hath giuen all iudgement vnto the Sonne.</hi> The Sonne by voluntary diſpenſation ſent by the Father, did empty himſelfe and lay aſide not onely the right of hauing dominion ouer eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry creature, but of exerciſing and ſhowing it forth in that nature he had aſſumed: The Father by vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary diſpenſation doth reſigne to the Sonne the

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> To the ſecond I anſwere, this ſoueraigntie is giuen to the perſon of the Sonne, both as God and man now aſcended; as God, for it is a power which none that is a pure creature can take or exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute; and the Scripture ſaith, <hi>The Lord ſaid to my Lord,</hi> that is, to <hi>Dauids</hi> ſeede, as hee was <hi>Dauids</hi> Lord, according as Chriſt expoundeth it by his queſtion; now <hi>Dauids</hi> ſeede was not <hi>Dauids</hi> Lord, as man, but as God. That it is giuen him as man, is plaine, becauſe it is giuen him now aſcended into heauen with his humane nature. Againe, that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is giuen to Chriſt as man, which is to be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him as man; but this kingdome is executed by Chriſt, ſo that his manhood doth concurre as an inſtrument working with his God-head in the adminiſtration of it, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.27. <hi>He hath giuen him power to execute iudgement, in as much as he is Sonne of man.</hi>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third is plaine, out of that <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. and <hi>Paul</hi> conſtruing it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.24.25. namely, that Chriſt ſhall giue vp this kingdome, and ceaſe to ſit at the right hand of God in this manner in which now he doth; for then he ſhall no longer by his manhood execute gouernment, neither ſhall he in manner appropriate his perſon, but together with the Father and Spirit like as they, ſo ſhall hee ioyntly with them rule, and be all in all for euer.</p>
               <pb n="375" facs="tcp:14192:202"/>
               <p>The ſecond point for clearing the Text is, what heauens are here vnderſtood; thoſe which <hi>Paul</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the third heauen, aboue the ayre, clouds, and ſtarrie firmament. Faith doth beleeue a place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue theſe, though Philoſophie know it not.</p>
               <p>To the third I anſwere, the perſons ouer whom Chriſt is aduanced, are firſt deſcribed more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, but yet obſcurely. Secondly, more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and plainely. The particular enumeration in theſe words; <hi>Principalities, powers, mights, domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</hi> The more full and plaine opening of them in the words following; <hi>Euery name,</hi> that is, euery creature howſoeuer named, whether in this world, or whether belonging to the world to come.</p>
               <p>But it is a queſtion, who are meant by the former words. <hi>Anſ.</hi> They are commonly vnderſtood of Angels; but I take the firſt two to be names of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, found in this preſent world. Firſt, <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities and powers,</hi> when they are put for Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall natures, they are not termed ſo ſimply, but with an addition of the place; as, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.12. but theſe words put for humane ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies, wee reade them ſimply, without any thing added. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Be ſubiect to principalities and powers.</hi> Againe, I thinke this diſtribution of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, named in this world and in that to come, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecteth ſomething in this enumeration forena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: the former, theſe two firſt named; the latter, the couple following: Thus I thinke alſo, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16. that enumeration of <hi>Thrones, Diminions, Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, Powers;</hi> the firſt two reſpect things inuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,

                  <hi>Principalities,</hi> ſignifie thoſe in principal authority.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Powers,</hi> all ſecondarie powers ſent from them, as <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh.</p>
               <p>By <hi>mights,</hi> I vnderſtand <hi>Angels,</hi> putting forth might in ſome miraculous effects of mercy, or iudgement; ſuch as the Angell, who did ſmite ſo many hundred thouſands in a night; the Angell which did the miraculous cure at the Poole, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Dominations</hi> I vnderſtand ſuch Angels, whoſe miniſterie God vſeth in the gouernement of king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and prouinces; for that God doth vſe their miniſterie, this may be gathered both out of <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſtes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The putting all things vnder his feete,</hi> noteth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but that ſubiection in which euery thing is to Chriſt, God onely excepted; reade, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.8.

I wiſh your eyes opened, that you may know the power of God toward you who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, through the working of the power which was wrought in Chriſt, when God did raiſe him from the loweſt degree of his humiliation, euen the ſtate of the dead, and did crowne him with digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and kingly glory in the heauens, not onely giuing him prerogatiue before both <hi>Principalities and powers,</hi> ſuch as wee ſee in earth; yea, before <hi>Mights and Dominations,</hi> ſuch as belong to the world to come; but giuing him power ouer theſe

               <p>Secondly, Chriſt doth by his ſufferings procure for vs all bleſſings ſpirituall and temporall, maketh a purchaſe of them with his bloud: Now he in his death reſpected not Angels in like kind; that looke as Kings prouide many things for their Queenes, which they doe not for other ſubiects, ſo doth Chriſt for vs.</p>

               <p>Fourthly, hee doth communicate with vs that whole life of grace and glory which wee haue, and ſhall receiue, as the naturall members haue no ſenſe or motion which floweth not into them from the head: But the Angels haue a bleſſed life; for the ſubſtance not comming to them by Chriſt, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as a mediator, euen that bleſſed life in which firſt they were created, that which commeth to them is onely an augmentation of happineſſe: their illumination and their ioy being in many regards much increaſed; they who learne by that they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue in the Church falling out, what doe they heare thinke we by inioying the preſence of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, now aſcended and glorified? and they who ioy in heauen at the conuerſion of one ſinner, how many waies by Chriſt is their ioy inlarged?</p>
               <p>Fiftly, hee doth not direct them as he doth vs; hee doth gouerne and direct them as a King doth voluntary ready ſubiects, by an externall ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his will onely; but he doth direct and moue vs, outwardly by ſignifying his will, inwardly by ſending his ſpirit, which might mooue vs with effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy to that hee ſhoweth, as a naturall head doth the members of it.</p>
               <p>Sixtly and laſtly, he doth not confirme them as he confirmeth vs; for he hath neither gotten by his death for them this grace of perſeuerance to the end, neyther doth hee ſhadow them and follow them with ayds outward and inward, as hee doth vs, left our faith ſhould be preuailed againſt; they haue beene no doubt confirmed from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:14192:212"/> both by force of their election, &amp; preuenting them with actuall grace, which made them with effect execute what euer thing it was in which it pleaſed God to proue their obedience, if they haue any confirmation from Chriſt their King, it is ſuch an one as doth make them ſtrong to ſubdue euill Angels, or any oppoſing them in buſineſſes, in which their miniſtery by Chriſt is imployed, ſuch an one may be gathered, <hi>Dan.</hi> 10.13.</p>

Were the Pope a miniſteriall head, hee might doe that which the principall, whoſe roome he ſupplieth as Viceroyes do, that in the kingdomes ouer which they are ſet, which the Kings might do in their owne perſons, whoſe roomes they ſupply; But the Pope cannot doe any inward thing which

               <p>Obſerue ſecondly, that he ſaith, <hi>this our head is ouer all:</hi> Whence note, that God of his grace, hath not onely giuen vs a head, but ſuch a head, to whom all things are ſubiect; he who muſt be a ſauing head to vs, there is great neede he ſhould be ouer all: Could he not binde that ſtrong one, and cauſe him redeliuer his poſſeſſion, how ſhould wee be euer ſet at liberty?

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The things are, all that fulneſſe of God, which beginneth in grace, is then perfected in glory when God ſhall be all in all. More particularly, he doth fill vs with righteouſneſſe and life; for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery thing filleth other with ſuch as it ſelfe hath: Now as the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> filleth his with ſinne and death; ſo the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> hath treaſured in him righteouſneſſe and life for all that are his; therefore hee is ſaid, <hi>Daniel</hi> 9.24. to haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away ſinne, and brought to vs eternall righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe; and hee is ſaid, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. to haue tooke away death, and brought to light life and immortalitie; the life, is either the life of grace,
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:14192:217"/> or of glory; the life of grace, is inward, or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: The inward grace of Chriſt, being that which doth dwell in the ſoule, principally chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, in the vnderſtanding, will and affections of it: which doth alſo ſecondarily ſhow it ſelfe in the body, both making the outward man more ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and awfull; <hi>Wiſedome maketh the face to ſhine,</hi> and alſo ſubiecting the members of it to it ſelfe, <hi>ſo as they become weapons of righteouſneſſe, Rom.</hi> 6. Euen as that cloud of Gods preſence, firſt filled the ſanctuary, and thence ſpread it ſelfe into the whole houſe; So the ſoule, being firſt <hi>filled with all knowledge and goodneſſe, Rom.</hi> 15.14. they breake out thence, and ſhow themſelues in the body, as the outward temple; <hi>Know ye not, your bodies are the temples of the holy Ghoſt?</hi> Now the externall grace which we receiue from Chriſt, is that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are in this or that ſtate and condition; ſome teachers, ſome gouernours, ſome taught and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned. Euen as the naturall force of <hi>Adam</hi> doth frame the matter of the naturall body, one part into an eye, another into a hand, &amp;c. ſo this is from Chriſt that the multitude of Gods choſen, who are the matter of his body myſticall, ſome are made members of one kinde, ſome of another, the life of glory is that which wee looke for from Chriſt in the heauens, both for ſubſtance and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of it. For looke as we haue, not onely from our firſt parents, a naturall life for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, both of ſoule and body, but alſo all the circumſtanciall ioy, which from times, places,
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:14192:218"/> creatures are incident to vs: So wee ſhall haue in Chriſt, and from him, not onely that glorious light of vnderſtanding and loue, wherewith wee ſhall loue God, now ſeeing him as he is: not onely thoſe glorious endowments of the body, whereby it ſhall become ſtrong, immortall, glorious, ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, but all the circumſtanciall ioy which ſhall in heauen be incident to our eſtates now glorified, wee ſhall be filled with it all through him.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> For the ſecond point, how we come to be filled: Theſe three things muſt be obſerued. Firſt, that all fulneſſe is in Chriſt, who hath receiued it without meaſure; <hi>We haue it from him according to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his gift, Ioh.</hi> 1. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. As the ſunne hath ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of light, in that perfection which doth agree to light; the Moone hath light from the Sunne in that meaſure wherein it is capable; ſo Chriſt, the Sunne of righteouſneſſe, hee hath fulneſſe without meaſure; but the Church, with all her members are filled from him, according to the capacitie of them, as members vnder him.</p>
               <p>Wee muſt know by what meanes we receiue our fulneſſe from Chriſt: To which the anſwere is by being partakers of Chriſt himſelfe, we come to be filled with the fulneſſe of grace and glory in him, as by eating and taking the ſubſtance of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nouriſhments, wee come to haue the vertue in them, euen to be filled with ſpirits and bloud in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred from them; ſo in Chriſt is life, by getting him wee come to partake in this life which floweth from him. More particularly, the meanes by which
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:14192:218"/> wee come to be made partakers of Chriſt and ſo to be filled, they be ſuch meanes as conueigh Chriſt to vs, or make vs receiue him. The firſt are the word and Sacraments, for as Perſons by their words, and by a ring doe contract and giue themſelues fully the one to the other: So doth Chriſt by his word offering vs himſelfe, and by his Sacraments as pledges and tokens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueigh himſelfe and beſtow himſelfe on vs. Now we receiue him partly by Humilitie, which doth emptie vs of our ſelues, and make roome for him, for pouerty and hunger are euery where made the forerunners of being filled: partly by Beliefe which doth feede on him and apply him, partly by walking in Chriſt, and exerciſing our ſelues ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually; <hi>be filled with the ſpirit, ſpeaking to your ſelues in Pſalmes,</hi> &amp;c. Our walking in Chriſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him ſettle and roote more and more in vs: Now the further hee dwelleth in vs, the more hee filleth vs; Beſide that, the nature of fire is to burne out further when it is blowed and mooued.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The laſt thing to be marked is the order and degrees wherein we come to be filled; now Chriſt doth fill vs firſt in regard of parts at our firſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion, in as much as he doth giue vs ſuch grace as doth oppoſe all ſinne, and incline vs to all obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, that though we can accompliſh nothing as we deſire, yet in the inner Man as wee are new creatures, wee delight in the Law of God: As the frame of an Infant is full for the members, though it is ſmall for quantity; ſo is the frame of our Grace.
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:14192:219"/> Secondly, we are filled with fulneſſe after a ſort for the preſent age of Child-hood, in which wee now liue: thus the Romanes are ſaid to be full of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and all knowledge; full after a ſort for this ſtate of Child-hood in which wee here liue, full in compariſon of more imperfect beginnings. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, laſtly. We are abſolutely filled with all that ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which doth belong to vs as members of Chriſt, and that is to be done in heauen heereafter: Looke as the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> communicateth and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth his Children with this naturall life, ſo as they are firſt infants, then ripe for children, then men: So Chriſt doth gradually impart vnto vs his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers this fulneſſe, which dwelleth in him.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> Wee ſee then that all fulneſſe is from Chriſt: how doe they then forget themſelues who ſeeke righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes out of him? That befalleth them, they leaue the well-head of all grace and glory, and digge Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternes which will not hold water.</p>

Bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Lords want none to reteyne to them, happy is hee who may ſhrowd himſelfe vnder their wings: Shall we not preſſe with reuerence to this Lord of Lords, who doth fill all in all with his ſpirituall bleſſings, who keepeth an open houſe, inuiteth, <hi>Ho, whoſoeuer thirſteth, let him come and drinke, yea drink freely the waters of life,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> 7.37. <hi>Whoſoeuer commeth to me, I will not caſt him forth?</hi> Chriſt may complaine as he did ſometime with that people of the Iewes, <hi>How oft would I haue gathered you, but you would not?</hi> So hee may ſay to vs, How oft
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:14192:219"/> would I haue had you, blinde, naked, miſerable by nature, come to me, that ye might be filled with righteouſneſſe and life, but ye haue refuſed? Well, did we know what wee are called to, and what wee might finde in him, then would we come and be ſuiters to him, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 4.10. <hi>But alas this is hid from our eyes.</hi>
